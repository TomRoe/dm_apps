The work to develop a LRP is a priority for resource managers. Creation of a LRP for Striped Shrimp in SFA 4 that considers the best available ecological and environmental data will ensure the sustainable management of this fishery through the identification of the point below which serious harm is occurring to the stock.Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification of shrimp fisheries is premised on Science advice. Specifically, a LRP for Striped Shrimp in SFA 4 is a condition to maintain MSC certification, and must be implemented by late-2022.","The Department relies on Science advice when considering management measures in support of resource sustainability. Without up to date Science advice, management measures would likely need to be continue to be conservative.MSC certification is premised on sound Science advice for the species in question. Science advice is required to maintain MSC certification.  Should Science not provide science advice, MSC certification may be impacted and pressure from industry and the Province of NL on the Department and the Minister would be significant, and the credibility of the Department may be eroded.",2/1/2023,"The MSC deadline is late-2022, but Science has advised that it is not possible to provide advice until Q4 of the 2022-23 fiscal year.
