TC, PC) following the pilot phase evaluationMay inform regulatory programs and species at risk management and recovery plans","DFO Arctic Region Marine Planning and Conservation (MPC) is leading finalization of an Active Sonar Mitigation Guide For Reducing Risks Caused by Underwater Noise for internal federal family use as an initial pilot prior to being offered publicly.  As part of the process, we require expert advice and/or peer review of the guide to ensure it is based on current information and is appropriate for external and internal use.The mitigation guide describes the conditions under which specified mitigation measures are applicable to Government of Canada led activities or projects involving the use of active sonar.The suggested measures are voluntary and can be incorporated into the planning and operation of navigation, research or hydrography and sea floor mapping activities in order to avoid or minimize negative impacts to the marine environment as a result of underwater noise.Questions for science: - Is the advice provided in the Active Sonar Mitigation Guide consistent with existing DFO Science advice ?- Is the advice provided in the Active Sonar Mitigation Guide consistent with current research/knowledge of impacts from active sonar noise?- Are the suggested measures suitable for mitigating the impacts of underwater noise produced by active sonar on marine animals?",Joclyn Paulic,"The advice coming from the peer review would directly inform the guide and decisions within regional programs on development, ocean floor mapping activities or research proposals related to sonar underwater noise. The guide and outcomes of the peer review would be useful for informing Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program decisions and considering how to minimize the impacts of underwater noise on marine mammals. There are initiatives under the OPP which would directly benefit from this information, such as Marine Environmental Quality. The Marine Planning and Conservation Program, Species at Risk Program and the Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program are involved in various planning and review activities that require the protection of the marine environment from the effects of active sonar activities.  Concerns from other departments, Industry, Northern Indigenous partners and stakeholders regarding the absence of approved 'guidelines' have been raised.The issue of the use of active sonar in or near Canadian waters and its impact on ocean ecosystems and marine life in particular is a significant one for the Arctic Region due to the increase in vessel activity and development in the north.   This review could lead to providing suggested mitigation measures to employ when working in proximity to protected areas and marine mammals.  Under the Oceans Act, the MEQ program has a mandate to identify science and management gaps, assess the impact of noise and other stresses on marine species and the ecosystems that sustain them and to develop or adapt measures to mitigate and manage risks. As part of the Establishing MEQ measures initiative of the Ocean Protection Plan, the MEQ program is committed to developing at least one measure to address noise and an Ocean Noise Strategy for Canada by 2021-2022. This information will be used by the MEQ program to inform appropriate underwater ocean noise measures.This information will also be used by the Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program as they are the lead in making regulatory decisions under the Fisheries Act and Species at Risk Act with respect to noise producing activities in the marine environment such as the use of active sonar. The advice may be combined with other departmental advice and submitted to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada or other regulators in support of federal/provincial and territorial environmental assessments.The potential impacts from underwater noise in the Arctic is of interest to Arctic Council members and particularly the Inuit people living throughout the region. Nationally, the Government of Canada Ocean Noise Strategy will promote the mitigation of harmful anthropogenic sourced underwater noise in Canadian Waters.  An active sonar guide used by federal departments is a logical first step.","The expected course of action if a science review is not provided is for the federal family and Industry to continue to undertake the use of active sonar in the absence of guidelines.  If this advice is not provided, the region would be unsuccessful in supporting further policy and regulatory recommendations which should reference the guide. In the absence of a guide, staff would direct internal programs and proponents to continue to apply ad hoc mitigation.  We would fail to advance effective mitigation of impacts from underwater noise on vulnerable species under DFO's purview, such as marine mammals, in the Arctic.  There is risk to the Department that elements of the guide will not be informed by current science and science advice. If key scientific information has evolved, the ability of the Department to properly manage a potentially harmful practice to many ecosystem elements may be negatively affected.

DFO Science conducts a multi-species bottom trawl survey in NAFO Subarea 0 to support assessment of the NAFO Subarea 0+1 (offshore) Greenland Halibut stock and biodiversity monitoring. The vessel and gear (Alfredo trawl) used for the survey was retired in 2018 without opportunity to conduct paired trawling experiments with an interim or replacement vessel. An interim vessel with the Alfredo trawl was used in 2019 and a new long-term vessel and new gear (Bacalao trawl) will be used in 2022 and beyond. Survey time series are typically standardized by conducting paired trawling experiments.  In the absence of these experiments DFO needs to determine what analytical method(s) could be used to compare data collected by  different vessels for use in assessing stock status, until a sufficient time series is established with the new vessel and gear to allow assessments based on those data alone.

Results of research on alternate gear types in the summer fishery has been published with suggestions on how to minimize Greenland Shark bycatch (e.g. fewer sharks captured on monofilament lines in summer), and similar research is now requested for the winter fishery. One option could be to alter logbooks to include information on gangion type (monofilament vs. standard twine gangion) to compare bycatch rates for different gear types.

This would likely require a mooring line across Cumberland Sound and tagging of Turbot within the Sound.DFO Science advice will be incorporated into draft IFMPs submitted for NWMB approval.The end users will be Nunavut wildlife co-managers: DFO, affected Hunters and Trappers Organizations (HTO) and Regional Wildlife Organizations (RWOs), the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB), and other resource users and stakeholders. DFO Science advice will be considered by the NWMB before communicating decisions to the Minister. The NWMB typically holds a public hearing to consider modifying levels of TAH, and hearing parties would most likely include fishing industry, territorial government, Designated Inuit Organizations (e.g. Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.) and the local Hunters and Trappers Organization.The provision of this information/advice is required to support departmental priorities:- The Cumberland Sound Greenland Halibut fishery is a key fishery for DFO Arctic Region, contributing to economically prosperous maritime sectors and fisheries (modernization of the fisheries). - A sustainable commercial fishery supports the development of commercial and emerging fishing activities in the North (responding to changing ecosystems, modernization of the fisheries).- Implementation of the Sustainable Fisheries Framework and the Fishery Decision-making Framework - Incorporating the Precautionary Approach are based on scientific information (responding to changing ecosystems).- Ensure coordinated approach to modernization of the fisheries, including providing science and fisheries management information (modernization of the fisheries).- Advice will be considered by stakeholders and fishing industry, deepening engagement and key partnerships.","Incomplete or outdated advice, used in management decisions, could negatively affect the species and the ecosystem and species will be affected if their current harvest exceeds sustainable levels. Without this advice it is unknown whether the currently established harvest levels are sustainable, and the Fishery Decision-making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach cannot be applied. Inappropriate harvest levels (management decisions) including the absence of sustainable harvest level recommendations could negatively affect the species and the ecosystem.Cumberland Sound Fisheries made a request to the NWMB in 2018 to increase the 500 t TAH for the CSTMA. The NWMB could not make a decision on this request at the time as the stock had never been assessed by DFO Science. Formal science advice following the CSAS meeting in November 2019 has not yet been published.Federal and territorial governments, industry and community resource users and stakeholders have all invested considerable resources into developing this fishery. For example, a Small Craft Harbour has been constructed in the community out of which this fishery is based. Without DFO Science advice, there is a risk that DFO will be unable to manage expectations and maintain confidence of fishery participants, potentially leading to the loss of partnerships. ",2024-25,"April 2, 2025","A stock assessment of the CSTMA occurred in November 2019, but was unable to provide advice on the connectivity to the offshore and if the stock could support an increase in quota as requested by Cumberland Sound Fisheries Ltd. to the NWMB. Therefore, the monitoring plan for this fishery should be continued and expanded to address the areas that are still unknown, including connectivity to the offshore and if the stock can support a TAH increase. 2025 or even 2026 seems to be a reasonable deadline to receive this science advice after a few years of data collection.

DFO is moving toward a Sustainable Fisheries Framework for key fisheries that contains existing DFO policies for resource management decisions, and builds on new policies to address ecosystems factors and precautionary considerations.  Narwhal are harvested not only in their summering ranges, but elsewhere during their spring/fall migration. Spring/fall narwhal harvests are presumed to target a migrating mix of different management units, but it has not been possible to assign spring/fall narwhal kills to individual management units. In 2010, new genetics analysis demonstrated some differences among narwhal summering aggregation stocks (Petersen et al. 2011/021).  Within Baffin Bay, partial support was found for the existing summering stock management unit designations. The analysis suggests that narwhals from Jones Sound and the Somerset Island summering stock are differentiated, although the Somerset Island finding may be influenced by low sample numbers. The report recommended that increased sampling of most stocks is suggested to increase the understanding of how stocks are related and at what rate migration among stocks may occur.

There is a growing interest among eastern Arctic communities in harvesting killer whales, for Food, Social & Ceremonial (FSC) purposes OR to alleviate killer whale predation on marine mammal species of cultural importance to Inuit (beluga, narwhal, bowhead).  Recent genetic/genomic analysis suggests that the NWA/EA population declined during the past few centuries of commercial whaling. Contaminants analysis of killer whales harvested in Greenland have resulted in advice against human consumption in West Greenland.  The question is in three parts:1. Is there sufficient information available from ongoing Canadian studies to determine the conservation impact of possible future harvests of NWA/EA killer whales in arctic Canada? If not, what is the projected timeline for collection and analysis? 2. Is there current evidence that human consumption of NWA/EA killer whales should be avoided in Canada? 3.

Permissible harvest levels (TAH/TAT) are not  established under the Nunavut Agreement or the Nunavik Inuit Land Claims agreement. The Marine Mammal Regulations (MMR) prohibit hunting killer whales without a license, except hunts  conducted by Aboriginal groups for FSC purposes.  While not considered a key regional fishery, killer whale seasonal range has expanded with declining sea ice cover. Inuit report increasing concern about killer whale predation impacts on marine mammal species of traditional importance to Inuit diet and culture.

With the completion of stock assessments for Halovik and Jayko Rivers in 2020 and an assessment for the Lauchlan River Planned for 2023, Ekalluktok (Ekalluk) and Surrey (Paliryuak) Rivers have been identified as the next rivers to be assessed. Advice should be provided in the context of the peer-reviewed standardized protocol developed for Arctic Char stock assessment by O&P Science, and advice should be provided as assessments on individual river systems are completed (i.e., multiple responses are anticipated from this single CSAS request).

Cambridge Bay Arctic Char is a key fishery for DFO Arctic Region. DFO is moving toward a Sustainable Fisheries Framework for key fisheries that contains existing DFO policies for resource management decisions, and builds on new policies to address ecosystems factors and precautionary considerations. Additionally, the Cambridge Bay Arctic Char fishery has been identified in Batch 2 of the Fish Stock Provisions, whereby a rebuilding plan will be required to support sustainable management.  The commercial fishery in Cambridge Bay began to operate in 1960 and has expanded the number of commercial water bodies exploited  to currently include 5 major water bodies (Ekalluktok (Ekalluk), Surrey (Paliryuak), Jayko, Halokvik (30 MILE), and Lauchlan (Byron Bay) Rivers). Stock assessment studies have been conducted by DFO sporadically on these active commercial water bodies throughout the years, and most recently in accordance with a multi-year Science plan established in 2013.  Ekalluktok (Ekalluk) and Surrey rivers are the remaining waterbodies that require population abundance estimates, stock structures and sustainable harvest levels.  The plant sampling program was implemented by DFO in an effort to collect annual basic information on the char harvested as part of monitoring efforts on the commercial fishery.  The plant sampling program is primarily the only scientific information DFO receives on these stocks and provides DFO with basic biological data. However, neither the sampling program nor harvest reporting capture complete CPUE. Given the scale and significance of this commercial fishery to the Region, the community and the Nunavut Territory, and the successful  approval of the Cambridge Bay Arctic Char Commercial Fishery IFMP in 2014, there is a need to complete population abundance estimates and establish sustainable harvest level recommendations for all commercial waterbodies, to ensure that these stocks are being harvested at sustainable levels and the fishery will continue to be sustainable over the long term. This need has been identified in the IFMP as an issue and objective of the fishery. Stock Assessment has developed a multi-year stock assessment plan for the Cambridge Bay fishery in conjunction with and in support of the Cambridge Bay Stock Assessment Working Group. This multi-year Science plan was approved in 2013 and is reviewed annually. Time-frames for completing population abundance estimates and establishing river specific sustainable harvest level recommendations have been determined, based on the Science plan and current activities.

Inuit harvesting rights are enshrined under s.35 of the Constitution Act (1982) and have paramountcy over subordinate Acts and Regulations (e.g. Fisheries Act; Marine Mammal Regulations). Each Agreement contains a defined process under which the Minister and the NWMB/NMRWB make wildlife management decisions. Decisions in relation to Inuit harvesting rights (NA 5.3.3, NILCA 5.5.3) shall restrict or limit Inuit harvesting only to the extent necessary: (a) to effect a valid conservation purpose, (b) to give effect to the allocation system outlined in Article 5 and 40 of the NA, or (c) to provide for public health or public safety.  The existing TAH (Nunavut)/ TAT (Nunavik) for ECWG Bowhead whales serve to (a) effect a valid conservation purpose of ensuring sustainable for all stocks and populations within the NSA.  These limitations may only restrict Inuit right to harvest to the extent necessary to effect this purpose.   The current bowhead management approach restricts Inuit from prosecuting unfilled annual bowhead quota in subsequent harvest seasons.  DFO Science advice will help determine whether a less restrictive harvest limitation, that enables carrying-forward unused annual strikes, can be implemented within the NSA / NMR while continuing to provide for the conservation and protection of the ECWG Bowhead population.

One option for obtaining a population estimate could be to use underwater cameras that are baited to attract sharks in the area. To examine population impacts of Greenland Shark bycatch, an assessment of post-capture survival rates is needed, as well as an assessment of fishery-dependent data on encounters, including catch rate (number of sharks), estimated length, state at time of capture (alive or dead, caught by mouth or entangled) and condition at release. Creel surveys may be an option for obtaining this information in real-time rather than relying on fishermen to recall this information after the fact.

",Kevin Hedges,"The Cumberland Sound Greenland Halibut fishery is a key fishery for DFO Arctic Region. DFO is moving toward a Sustainable Fisheries Framework for key fisheries that contains existing DFO policies for resource management decisions, and builds on new policies to address ecosystems factors and precautionary considerations.In the first two years of a summer (open water) fishery, the Cumberland Sound Turbot Management Area (CSTMA) fishery experienced very high Greenland Shark and Arctic Skate bycatch. In 2009 and 2010, the highest shark bycatches occurred at the beginning of the fishing season, though this corresponded to different dates (the duration of September in the first year and early August in the second year). Data obtained thus far seem most consistent with the sharks being “fished out” at the beginning of the fishing season, rather than seasonal movement of sharks into and out of the CSTMA. An open water fishery also occurred in the NAFO Division 0B portion of Cumberland Sound in 2010 and 2011, and also experienced very high shark bycatch. An ice fishery, prosecuted annually since 1986, also experiences shark bycatch.Survival rates of live-released discarded sharks is unknown. Thus, to ensure that viability of the shark population is not being compromised, DFO Resource Management requires that impacts of the Greenland Shark (and potentially Arctic Skate) bycatch in the Cumberland Sound Greenland Halibut fishery be investigated. Obtaining an estimate of population abundance will be an important first step prior to assessing impacts of bycatch on the Greenland Shark population in Cumberland Sound.DFO Resource Management will use this advice to provide recommendations to the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) to mitigate impacts on Greenland Sharks. DFO Science advice will be considered by the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) in providing a Total Allowable Harvest (TAH) decision to the Minister. The NWMB typically considers establishing or modifying levels of TAH in a public forum, and vocal parties would most likely include fishing industry, territorial government, Designated Inuit Organizations (e.g. Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.) and the local Hunter's and Trapper's Organization.The Precautionary Approach involves setting biologically based reference points and establishing pre-agreed, risk-based actions.This information is required as part of an Integrated Fisheries Management Plan.The provision of this information/advice is required to support departmental priorities:- The Cumberland Sound Greenland Halibut fishery is a key fishery for DFO Arctic Region, contributing to economically prosperous maritime sectors and fisheries (modernization of the fisheries). - A sustainable commercial (or exploratory) fishery supports the development of commercial and emerging fishing activities in the North (responding to changing ecosystems, modernization of the fisheries).- Implementation of the Sustainable Fisheries Framework and the Fishery Decision-making Framework - Incorporating the Precautionary Approach are based on scientific information (responding to changing ecosystems).- Ensure coordinated approach to modernization of the fisheries, including providing science and fisheries management information (modernization of the fisheries).- Advice will be considered by stakeholders and fishing industry, deepening engagement and key partnerships.","It is unknown whether the current bycatch levels are sustainable for bycatch species, especially Greenland Shark. Although bycatches in offshore Greenland Halibut fisheries appear to be well within a limit of 5% of the weight of the directed species, for each species on a per trip basis, in the first two seasons of a CSTMA open water Greenland Halibut fishery, this limit has been exceeded. The ice fishery, prosecuted annually since 1986, also experiences shark bycatch. At the same time, federal and territorial governments, industry and community resource users and stakeholders have all invested considerable resources into developing this fishery. For example, a Small Craft Harbour is being constructed in the community where this fishery is based. Without DFO Science advice, there is a risk that DFO will be unable to manage expectations and maintain confidence of fishery participants, potentially leading to the loss of partnerships. The Nunavut Agreement states that decisions of the NWMB or a Minister shall limit Inuit harvesting only to the extent necessary to effect a valid conservation purpose (Section 5.3.3 (a)). Without this advice, the case for a valid conservation purpose remains less definitive.",2023-24,"April 4, 2024","An estimate of population abundance could likely be obtained sooner, but the full assessment of population impacts resulting from bycatch may require a longer timeframe of 2023-24.

","Cortney Watt, Science, Ontario & Prairie Region","There is currently a quota of 41 beluga in the community of Pangnirtung. The issue of multiple stocks has been raised by the community for decades and needs to be answered to be able to move forward with effective management of the species. If a second population (the ""other"" whales) can be identified, there is a possibility for management decisions to be made which further protect the threatened Cumberland Sound population in Clearwater Fjord through harvest adjustments. If the ""other"" whales are from a much larger population, then there is the potential of allowing greater harvesting from that population and relieving stress due to harvest on the Threatened Cumberland Sound population. If they are all one genetic population then future stock assessments (genetic mark recapture, satellite imagery, or aerial) will need to be designed to ensure the whales remaining in Cumberland Sound are included to provide accurate population estimates.The end users will be Nunavut wildlife co-managers: DFO, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB), the Regional Wildlife Organizations (RWO), Hunters and Trappers Organizations (HTO), Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI), the Nunavut Inuit Wildlife Secretariat (NIWS) and the Government of Nunavut.

Within these areas, certain habitat management activities (e.g. water level manipulation and some aquatic vegetation removal) have been used to maintain hemi-marsh conditions (i.e., 50/50 emergent/open water habitat) and are prescribed in site management plans.  Diked areas within Big Creek and St. Clair NWAs in Ontario Region have had ongoing water level/aquatic vegetation management (approximately once a decade, but due to permitting constraints, at times on longer time frames) for the past 25 to 60 years.  Short-term water level drawdowns result in improved habitat conditions for waterfowl and, despite the obvious loss of habitat in the short term (as well as possible harm or jeopardy to survival and recovery of some species), also appear to improve habitat conditions for wetland SARA listed fishes and other SARA listed species in the long term. Previous assessment (CSAS Response 2021/012) specifically examined short-term ecological impact of water-level drawdown on lake chubsucker in the east cell of St Clair NWA but did not consider long-term risks of inaction, the long-term benefits of habitat management to lake chubsucker, or impacts or benefits at any timescale to other SAR.   1. What are the short and long-term risks and benefits of habitat management activities on SARA listed  species in closed wetland systems (e.g. do nothing approach, during draw-down over a single or multiple years, immediately afterwards and one year later)?2. Are there mitigation measures that could be implemented to minimize the impacts of habitat manipulations on SARA listed species and their critical habitat (e.g., minimum water levels to be maintained, timing and duration, precautions to limit predation, precautions to relocate, stocking/re-introductions, etc.)?3. What are potential offsets that provide maximum benefit to the SARA listed species given feasibility constraints of the site (i.e. cost, scale, multi-species,current condition of habitat, availability of degraded habitat for restoration)?  4. How can the answers to questions above be incorporated into a multi-species SARA permitting strategy for water-level drawdowns at NWAs nationally?ECCC (CWA)is seeking to collaborate with DFO on this review to allow for them to provide for consideration related to species under their mandate.",Neil Fisher and Kyle Antonchuk discussed this proposal with Science (Joclyn Paulic and Lynn Bouvier)and it was reviewed by Andrew Drake. ECCC has also had input to this request. ,"The Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) and Ducks Unlimited have been engaged in habitat manipulations (predominantly for improving waterfowl habitat) within diked wetlands for some time and continue to propose work with the potential to impact SARA listed species and their critical habitat.  The science advice requested will provide a better understanding of how habitat manipulations and water drawdowns may impact multiple species and their habitat/critical habitat over time (particularly long-term), and what mitigations and/or offsets can be considered to ensure that habitat is not degraded over time from lack of maintenance or management.  The advice will provide the knowledge base required to make informed ecosystem-based decisions with respect to SARA permits that may allow projects to proceed; the advice will also be useful in engaging other organizations in making evidence-based decisions to provide maximum benefit to multiple species which may have competing needs within diked wetlands.  The advice is likely to inform questions about similar work in other locations and regions of interest to DFO.This information will promote an ecosystem approach (that includes the needs of SAR fishes) to habitat manipulations within diked areas of coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes.  Previously, such initiatives were focused on waterfowl and to a lesser extent, other non-fish taxa.  The request will help ECCC and DFO fulfill their roles under SARA of promoting the survival and recovery of SARA listed species found in diked wetlands. This will improve regulatory efficiencies and hopefully reduce administrative delays and conflict.","If science advice is not provided, there could be negative effects on SARA listed species of fish, waterfowl, and other taxa if permits are not obtained and habitat is not managed within impoundments. For example, hemi-marsh conditions and diverse native plant communities may continue to degrade, invasive species may spread, and repairs to dikes may be limited to health and safety situations where impacts on SARA listed species are secondary to other risks.

The removal of stands of this species have generally been viewed as beneficial for the fish community including species at risk. As management agencies seek to control this invasive species, consideration of the potential impacts to SAR stemming from management/control activities for invasive species should factor into guidance to proponents. Science advice, drawing from completed research and further sampling, is needed to provide insight in the following areas:1) Do SAR wetland fishes use Common Reed as habitat in at least some situations where the invasive species occurs? Is this species used as habitat only due to absence of other desired habitat? Does Common Reed have negative, neutral, or positive associations with some of our SAR wetland fishes?; 2) is there a gradient of habitat value depending on the density of Common Reed (e.g., stem count) or location of stands (near shore vs. offshore islands,shallow vs. adjacent to deeper areas)? ;3) Do Common Reed control methods have adverse impacts to SAR or at least the fish community in general? What are the least harmful methods of control?;4) Are there options to eradicate Common Reed or are management efforts longterm? If they are long term, and control efforts impact SAR fishes, do the benefits of temporary habitat maintenance and control outweigh the cumulative impacts to SAR or the fish community?

Recent droughts in the Cowichan River watershed have resulted in lower than normal summer water levels in the lake which has resulted in reduced outflows to the river as well as dewatering of lake margins, some of which is identified as critical habitat for Vancouver Lamprey, an aquatic species endemic to the the lake and listed as Threatened under the Species at Risk Act. Most recently in late summer 2021, a request was made to install pumps at the weir to maintain a minimum (4.5 cms) downstream flow of water to the Cowichan River in the event that lake levels dropped below the outlet control elevation level of the weir. Pumping water out of Cowichan Lake to maintain downstream fish habitat would further decrease lake levels which would potentially have a negative effect on spawning and rearing critical habitat for Vancouver Lamprey.    This science request is to identify 1) what are the ranges of water levels required to provide maximum protection to Vancouver Lamprey and its critical habitat, and when are these water levels required by the species; 2) how much of this critical habitat (in square meters or hectares) is being affected by lake draw downs and when; and 3) what kinds of enhancement/rehabilitation opportunities exist for Vancouver Lamprey in the Cowichan Lake watershed?

The research team already includes a member from DFO Science Maritimes who has been working with T. Therriault on a National SPERA project that will inform some of the risk calculations planned here. ," Commercial shipping has long been recognized as an important vector for the introduction and spread of Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS).  However, the risk of domestic shipping has not been characterized for British Columbia (BC), especially the Northern Shelf Bioregion, where vessel traffic from both international destinations and ports in Southern BC pose a risk. For example, there are a number of higher risk AIS established in Southern BC that are not yet established in Northern BC. The threat posed by these AIS, especially to valued ecosystem components identified by coastal First Nations, links directly to Government of Canada commitments under the Oceans Protection Plan and Reconciliation Framework Agreements.  In order to inform the development of policy and regulations, this risk must be quantified and peer-reviewed via a CSAS process to ensure a robust and rigorous advisory process.   ","This request has been developed via ongoing discussions with Dr. Therriault in DFO Science Pacific Region who leads the AIS Science Program regionally.  A team of collaborators has been developed to undertake the planned work which includes individuals from Transport Canada, DFO Science (both Pacific and Maritimes (C. DiBacco)), and Coastal Resource Mapping with input from coastal First Nations. ","The advice stemming from this process will have utility to TC, DFO, and Coastal First Nations.  Specifically, advice will inform TC commitments under its Cumulative Effects of Marine Shipping Initiative (development of mitigation/management strategies to mitigate and/or manage regional cumulative effects from marine shipping)and could inform future regulatory changes to the Canadian Shipping Act.  The results of this risk assessment can also inform AIS management in BC via the AIS NCP and early detection monitoring programs being led by DFO Science and Coastal First Nations.","There are a number of high risk invaders that can be redistributed in BC via commercial shipping including ballast water-mediated movements or in relation to hull fouling.  Early detection monitoring programs in northern BC will suffer without this advice. TC has identified and prioritized valued ecosystem components alongside Coastal First Nations under a Reconciliation Framework Agreement to which impacts of aquatic invasive species on harvestable resources and uses has been identified. The objective of this work is to strengthen and protect Indigenous communities’ safe access to and ability to undertake marine and shoreline harvesting activities, and important Indigenous cultural features by managing the negative impacts of marine traffic in their territories (including from aquatic invasive species). Without this advice early detection and risk would go unmitigated, impacting Indigenous use and access to their harvest and use of their territories.

The additional advice sought on Southern Resident Killer Whales (SRKW), would be of interest to other sectors in the region who are involved in SRKW management.","1) Identify and assess the assumptions, merits and limitations of applying a Framework for Underwater Noise (FUN) for:a. determining the potential adverse effects of underwater noise on cetaceans as a result of Development Projects; and b. evaluating the effectiveness of measures to offset Project-related adverse effects.2) Identify and assess the assumptions, merits and limitations of applying FUN to TMX-related adverse effects of underwater noise on southern resident killer whales (SRKW) in the Salish Sea.The request builds on Science Advice provided in the context of the Roberts Bank Terminal 2 Project, Saguenay Marine Terminals and a workshop Ecosystem Management Branch (EMB) is holding with DFO research scientists to explore the assumptions, merits and limitations of a framework being develop to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to offset adverse effects from TMX Project-related underwater noise on SRKW. EMB expects to finalize a draft framework as part of an internal status report by March 2022, along with initial modelling studies of the effectiveness of existing underwater noise management measures to reduce to offset Project-related vessels. Peer review science advice will enable EMB to better understand the merits and risks of using this approach generally to inform underwater noise management, achieve greater clarity on past science advice (e.g. how to achieve no-net increase in underwater noise), inform further development of the Offset Program and offset measures for TMX, and assist the Government of Canada in its provision of advice and decision making on marine development projects.","Kim Houston, Sean MacConnachie, Michel Breton, Monique Goit, Svein Vagle.","The CER recommended that the Governor in Council (GIC) implement an Offset Program which would offset the underwater noise and strike risk from TMX Project-related vessels to SARA listed aquatic species in the marine Project area. The GIC committed to implement measures to address the significant adverse effects on SRKW, and implement measures to avoid or lessen the effects, monitor them and to adaptively manage them. As part of this work, DFO science has built on activities under the Oceans Protection Plan (OPP) to establish an underwater noise baseline in the marine Project area, develop an acoustic model, and take steps to model the incremental noise from Project related vessels and relative effectiveness of existing underwater noise management measures. Currently, there does not exist a framework for evaluating the potential effectiveness of measures to offset underwater noise as a result of Development Projects. EMB is working to develop such a framework that will be informed by a workshop with subject matter experts in December 2021. The development of a draft framework will be accompanied by initial modelling work evaluating  the effectiveness of underwater noise management measures to offset TMX-related noise. The Framework being developed builds on past Science advice, most notably the recommendation to implement measures in order to achieve net-zero increase in underwater noise. EMB cannot be confident in the degree to which the proposed framework for evaluating Project-related underwater noise offsetting is scientifically defensible without the requested peer review. The advice will be used to further refine the framework for continued evaluation of underwater noise management measures which will in turn impact how the measures themselves are adaptively managed over time. ","Should advice not be received then EMB would not be able to make a decision on whether to pursue the proposed Framework for Underwater Noise.  As such, EMB will be unable to confidently evaluate whether TMX-related effects from underwater noise on SRKW have been fully offset. This could be poorly received by stakeholders and contribute to increased legal and operational risks associated with the TMX Project decision.

Science has recently completed surveys of the Tuzo Wilson seamounts (Pac2021-036) and the uniqueness and diversity of the ecosystem exceeded their expectations. The Tuzo Wilson seamounts are outside existing protected areas and are the only seamounts in the Canadian Pacific that are still accessible by bottom contact fisheries.

The scope of the response should be similar to the recent science response published for the Offshore Pacific AOI (DFO, 2019a). Oceans would like Science to map the natural boundaries of the Tuzo Wilson seamount complex (updating mapping in DFO, 2021), describe any unique oceanographic characteristics, map important habitat features, and list any important species that occur there. If possible, Science should identify the relevance of the seamount to life histories of important species and contextualize the information within known vulnerabilities and the resilience of habitats on the seamount. Key uncertainties and knowledge gaps should be identified, along with recommendations to address them if possible. Because Tuzo Wilson is an EBSA, it can be characterized as a sensitive benthic area (SiBA; DFO, 2019b), so Oceans would like an estimate of the historical and current fishing footprint and associated impacts by fishing sector and gear type. The science response should include any additional information that might be useful for developing management options (e.g. an assessment of how Tuzo Wilson seamounts compare to other seamounts in the Offshore Pacific Bioregion).

Recognizing that this is an enormous undertaking Oceans suggests the following prioritization of areas:  1. Existing MPAs and AOIs 3. Northern Shelf Bioregion4. Southern Shelf Bioregion5. Offshore Pacific Bioregion6. Strait of Georgia Bioregion,Cherisse Du Preez,"Cold seeps occur where hydrocarbon-rich water escapes from beneath the sea floor, often near boundaries of tectonic plates, and are characterized by unique communities associated with chemosynthetic bacteria and carbonate crust structures (DFO, 2018). Many of the species found in these communities may be endemic to cold seeps, which were designated as Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) in the Pacific Region in 2018 (DFO, 2018). Despite this, cold seeps have never been systematically inventoried or mapped within the region, although they have been found in three of the four bioregions. Relative to the American Pacific coast, we have very little information on the location and extent of cold seeps, but Science estimates that there are likely thousands within the Canadian Pacific region (DFO, 2018). Much like hydrothermal vents, cold seeps can form large rocky structures, providing places for cold water corals and sponges to anchor and shelter areas for ecologically and commercially important fish species (DFO, 2018). One of the most well studied cold seeps, the site of a research node for Ocean's Network Canada, was discovered when a trawl fisherman brought up a chunk of solid methane hydrate in his net (DFO, 2018). This indicates that cold seep features may be vulnerable to impacts from bottom contact fishing and, as we don't know where they are, they remain unprotected. This is an important gap in our understanding of Pacific benthic ecosystems, which could be remedied with systematic multibeam mapping of the region. In addition to locating cold seeps, multibeam mapping would yield other important benefits because the data are broadly useful for marine spatial planning and monitoring of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (Brown et al., 2012). Multibeam maps can be used to help locate and quantify benthic landscape features and ecological processes for conservation prioritization and can be used to build species distribution models for species of concern e.g. sessile species like corals and sponges (Brown et al., 2012; Proudfoot et al., 2020).  Systematic multibeam mapping would also allow Oceans to ensure new MPAs  (established to meet conservation targets of 25% by 2025 and 30% by 2030) are sited so that the resulting networks are representative of the full diversity of habitats within the Pacific Region (Proudfoot et al., 2020).

Identifying EBSAs is now a first step in the creation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) designated under the Oceans Act (DFO 2010). This approach is in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 2008), and was re-emphasized in Canada's National Framework for Canada's Network of Marine Protected Areas (DFO 2011). EBSAs will also help inform marine planning initiatives managed by other federal and provincial departments/agencies—such as spill response activities, resource extraction, and marine shipping. Although marine EBSAs have been identified across the Pacific Region, the methodology, criteria used, and age of the underlying data used to inform EBSAs in the Southern Shelf and Strait of Georgia Bioregions (SSB & SOGB) is most in need of an update. The scientific knowledge used to identify the EBSAs in the SSB & SOGB is also more than 10 years old—despite DFO Science’s recommendation that EBSAs be re-evaluated every 5 years (DFO 2011). This compares to data in the Northern Shelf Bioregion (NSB) and Offshore Bioregion that are 3 and 5 years old, respectively. Additionally, the processes that identified EBSAs in the Offshore Bioregion (DFO 2016) and NSB (Clarke and Jamieson 2006a,b; DFO 2018) used newer, empirical-based methodologies instead of the older, expert-based Delphic process used in the SSB & SOGB (Jamieson & Levesque 2014; Levesque & Jamieson 2015. Finally, EBSAs identified in the SSB and SOGB relied on criteria developed by DFO (DFO 2014), and did not integrate criteria developed by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 2008). As a signatory party of the CBD, Canada has committed to adopting these new scientific criteria for identifying EBSAs.The Oceans Program sees this process as mirroring RSIA #2014OCN01 which led to the reassessment of EBSAs in the Northern Shelf Bioregion (DFO 2018) using a standardized methodology that is consistent among all sites and bioregions and integrates newly-developed CBD criteria. End-users of this work will include Government of Canada staff involved in planning and implementing  various marine conservation tools—including Oceans Act MPAs and marine refuges by DFO, National Marine Conservation Areas by Parks Canada, and Marine National Wildlife Areas by Environment and Climate Change Canada. This science advice will also inform broader DFO initiatives related to marine spatial planning, species at risk, fisheries management, and marine spill response. Stakeholders and First Nations will use this information to participate in marine conservation processes. Given the importance of EBSAs in marine planning initiatives across the Pacific Region, science information and advice is needed so that this foundational knowledge is consistent, up-to-date, and as accurate as possible. A reassessment of SSB & SOGB EBSAs will ensure that marine spatial planning and oceans management decisions continue to be based on the best available science.

Prior to the listing decision being made, several projects, such as the replacement of the George Massey Tunnel, are expected to commence in the Lower Fraser River, where Eulachon are known to spawn. The Department is currently unable to assess the impact of activities likely to cause harm to Eulachon habitat. It is anticipated there is sufficient information to identify important habitat for the Fraser River DU, and it would be advantageous to have this science advice in advance large projects getting underway. It would also be advantageous to have this advice in advance of development of a Recovery Strategy (to avoid financial and resource burden in reconsulting at a later date). If Fraser River DU and/or the Central Pacific Coast (CPC) DU are listed as Endangered under Schedule 1 of SARA, s. 41(1)(c) and 49(1)(a) require ""an identification of the species' critical habitat, to the extent possible, based on the best available information"" in a recovery strategy for endangered species.

Furthermore, if the advice is provided after the Recovery Strategy is developed, this will cost the Department significant resources. Not identifying important habitat at the earliest feasible point in the SARA recovery planning process puts the Department at increased risk for litigation and possibly raise concerns from interested Indigenous groups. Identification of critical habitat for SARA-listed species is a requirement under the Species at Risk Act (SARA s. 41(1)(c)), including the information provided by COSEWIC, examples of activities that are likely to result in its destruction, and a schedule of studies to identify critical habitat, where available information is inadequate. Protection of critical habitat is a vital component of recovery of listed SAR and a primary means of addressing threats to the species.

Discussions are underway between the SARP TKW Recovery Team and the Pacific Ecosystem Stressors Program to scope the study. TKW is listed as Threatened under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). The specific question to be answered by Science is: Based on a systematic assessment of both individual and combined threats (as outlined in the draft amended TKW Recovery Strategy), which threats (or combination of threats) best explain the observed population growth and in turn may have a greater influence on the population trajectories and demographics of TKW into the future?","Discussions occurred in lead up to RSIA 2020/21 review between the SARP TKW Recovery Team and the Pacific Ecosystem Stressors Program (lead: Cathryn Murray) to refine the scope of the study. The Ecosystem Stressors Program is supportive of this project, and has begun work on it.","The SARA draft amended Recovery Strategy (aRS) (2020) and draft Action Plan (AP) (2020) for TKW describe the most pressing anthropogenic threats to TKW: 1) environmental contaminants; and 2) noise and disturbance. As stated in the draft aRS, ‘the extent to which current threats may act synergistically or cumulatively to impact Killer Whales is unknown. In other species, multiple stressors have been shown to have strong negative and often lethal effects, particularly when animals carry elevated levels of environmental contaminants’. A high priority recovery measure (RM7) addressing the question of cumulative impacts on TKW was included in the TKW AP: ‘Assess cumulative effects of potential anthropogenic impacts on Transient Killer Whales using an appropriate impact assessment framework for aquatic species’.  This same RM but for Resident Killer Whales (RKW) was the basis for a study led by the Pacific Ecosystem Stressors Program in 2019, where a cumulative effects assessment (CEA) framework was developed and applied for Northern and Southern Resident Killer Whale populations (NKW and SRKW) (listed as Threatened and Endangered, respectively). Results indicated that the cumulative threats model was a better predictor of observed demographic rates for both populations than individual threats models. Findings of this CEA highlight the importance of considering threats collectively when faced with implementing recovery measures for Killer Whale populations.As stated in the 2019 RKW CEA, ‘the framework [developed for RKW] is a potentially useful tool for managers and scientists… and could also be applied to other populations and species’. A TKW-focused CEA will be useful for SARP recovery planners – as well as to other programs and Departments including (but not limited to) DFO Oceans, DFO Science and Transport Canada - in their efforts towards survival and recovery of TKW specifically, by helping to adaptively inform and/or implement recovery measures. For example, the model could be used to evaluate the impacts of development or other proposals (e.g., commercial pinniped harvest proposals), including possible mitigation and management actions, on the long-term survival and recovery of the population, thereby informing departmental priorities, decisions and actions.Lastly, the development of a CEA specific to TKW will provide an additional ‘pilot’ alongside the RKW CEA, further demonstrating the potential applicability of the model to other marine species in Canada affected by multiple threats.","The draft AP developed for TKW identifies the assessment of the cumulative effects of anthropogenic threats impacting this population as a high priority, to be carried out within a 2-year time frame. Related RMs within the AP are also high priority, including two ongoing/as needed measures RM5 and RM13: ‘Consider the needs of Transient Killer Whales when undertaking management actions that affect prey species (e.g., cull or commercial harvest, issuance of nuisance seal permit applications)’ and ‘Review and assess project impacts on Transient Killer Whales and their habitat, and provide advice on impact avoidance and mitigation measures as required’. If Science advice is not provided, these RMs will not be effectively addressed within the stated time frames, and departmental priority-setting and messaging on why specific management options related to TKW are supported (or not) will be much more challenging. Overall, Killer Whales in Canadian Pacific waters are iconic populations of significant interest at regional, national and international levels, with frequent media coverage of all three ecotypes. Should up-to-date Science advice on TKW not be provided, and management measures informed by Science not be enacted, the Department will likely be subject to public scrutiny and possibly even litigation.",2023-24,"December 31, 2023","To date, most research on the threats to Killer Whales (including TKW) has studied threats in isolation, e.g., focusing solely on acoustic disturbance or prey availability. By combining the best available scientific information on TKW into a single assessment that includes the key threats to the population, the interactions between these threats, and the resulting long-term impacts on the population, the department and others working collaboratively to recover TKW will be better informed and thus better able to consider impacts to TKW when, e.g.:• Completing a COSEWIC re-assessment of the population – Upcoming/Date Unknown• Responding to development proposals through Environmental Assessment review processes – Ongoing• Meeting legal or regulatory requirements, e.g., through the development of permits or agreements under s.73 or s.74 of SARA, or the provision of exceptions under s.83 of SARA – OngoingBroadly speaking, the SARA recognizes the importance of conserving Canada’s biodiversity, and the Act is central to meeting Canada’s commitments under the UN Convention on Biodiversity.

Robust ecosystem models built upon best available science that elucidate linkages among species, and are able to predict impacts of changing human activities on SAR, can be used to guide effective management of multi-use areas, particularly where there are competing management objectives, e.g., competing conservation objectives among single-species management models, competing marine sector economic objectives.To advance recovery of threatened and endangered killer whales in Canadian Pacific waters, while also addressing their declining (e.g., salmon, herring) or increasing (e.g., pinnipeds) prey in the context of multiple marine pressures, the Species at Risk Marine Team in collaboration with the Marine Mammal Unit (MMU) are requesting that a multi-species ecosystem model for coastal British Columbia be built that includes (but may not be limited to): killer whales, salmon, seals, sea lions, and herring. This model will generate critical insight into ecosystem processes (socio-ecological) impacting killer whales (as the focal species); will provide a quantitative framework for understanding the effects of human activities on population dynamics of SAR and key fisheries resources; and, will be used to evaluate and predict future numbers (e.g., population metrics) given changing human activities. These insights will help inform effective management interventions that maximize economically- and culturally- important salmon and herring fishery resources while addressing recovery of killer whale populations.The model will be based on recent scientific findings (including from DFO Science), and will consist of: (1) a main predator-prey model focused on Southern Resident Killer Whale and Chinook salmon; and (2) aligned sub-models (related to salmon, pinnipeds, etc.).  This advice may have impacts to Science, Salmon Management, Fisheries Management, and the SARA program in the Pacific Region, linking to NRKW, SRKW and TKW considerations. Impacts to other regions are unlikely, but as both Killer Whale and salmon populations are managed in collaboration with the USA, it is expected that this information may be used by American colleagues in support of Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) recovery efforts and salmon management in US waters, and will be of significant interest.In terms of advancing species' recovery under SARA, this model will be addressing numerous recovery approaches/measures in the Resident Killer Whale Action Plan and the Transient Killer Whale Recovery Strategy (2007).

Although data for individuals in the Northern population indicates that they are currently robust, any decrease in their body condition will likely result in further scrutiny of DFO's management of prey species.

Offshore Killer Whales (OKW) have a small population size (approx. 300 individuals in 2013), and one of the main reason for their COSEWIC designation as threatened was the small number of mature individuals. Although the population is thought to be stable, a recent preliminary analysis by CRP indicates that the discovery curve for OKW may still be increasing. As per SARA S. 24, COSEWIC must review species at risk classifications every ten years.

Do recent data (2011-present) suggest that changes are warranted to the currently identified critical habitat functions, features, and attributes? Are there additional areas (or fewer areas) considered critical to the survival or recovery of this threatened population?In 2013, science advice identifying areas of special importance to the threatened Transient Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) in Canadian Pacific waters were provided through the CSAS process (see Ford et al. 2013). This advice pertained specifically to those Transients showing the most fidelity to inner coast waters (i.e., what were referred to as 'inner coast Transients' in Ford et al. 2013). Insufficient data were available to identify areas of special importance to those Transients showing less fidelity to coastal waters, and therefore less frequently encountered ('outer coast Transients'). A geographic area (3 nautical miles extending off the entire British Columbia coast) and functions, features, and attributes critical to the survival and recovery of inner coast Transient Killer Whales were identified in the previous science advice.Since the previous science advice was received, there has been a marked increase in the number of documented encounters with Transient Killer Whales, primarily in inner coast waters, including in the Salish Sea where threats to Transients (e.g., acoustic and physical disturbance) are recognized to be high. This encounter data is currently being used by the Cetacean Research Program (CRP) to inform an updated population status assessment for Transient Killer Whales (see RSIA 2019SAR02), and is therefore readily available to the CRP to inform updated science advice on critical habitat for this population.

However, with the shift to electronic monitoring (EM) in the trawl sector, a review of biosampling protocols to determine efficacy of current procedures and any improvements that can be made.The current request is to review the current biosampling protocols in the Groundfish Fisheries. Industry representatives from all of the Groundfish sectors have expressed concerns regarding the spatial and temporal coverage, and reliability of biosamples, particularly with the removal of at-sea observers in early 2020 due to Covid-19, whose responsibility it was to collect biosamples on Trawl fishing trips. Currently there is no procedure for biosamples to be collected from the Trawl sector.This request is also to review the capacity and resources in the Aging Lab at the Pacific Biologial Station. Concerns have been raised frequently regarding the the capacity of the Aging lab at the Pacific Biological Station. Aging information (weight, length at catch, size-at-age, age-at-catch, sex, etc.) is critical for stock assessments and subsequently informing management decisions. The current biosampling protocols don't necessarily provide the data required to support assessment work. This request builds on internal discussions that took place between DFO Fisheries Management and Science  in June 2020 about exploring existing Groundfish sampling data from the last ~10 years across gear types and areas to identify gaps in sampling coverage for species for which biological information on catch is required (e.g., for assessments).","Greg Workman (Groundfish Science Section Head)(Steven Schut A/Groundfish Science Section Head), Luke Rogers (Aquatic Science Biologist)","The approach to biological sampling for groundfish species was last reviewed approximately 15 years ago. Since that time, there have been substantial changes to the characteristics of groundfish fleets, the relative abundance of stocks including the emergence of ""choke point"" stocks, and the demands placed on Science for advice in support of management decisions.  The advancement of spatial planning (e.g., marine zoning) has increased the complexity of obtaining biological samples from commercial, recreational and First Nations fisheries.  Furthermore, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced changes to at-sea monitoring for groundfish trawl fisheries that introduced at-sea Electronic Monitoring (EM) in lieu of the At-Sea Observer Program (ASOP).  These changes mean that the existing sampling strategies may not be well matched to current constraints and requirements.  Biological sampling of fisheries is vital to estimating key stock assessment components such as recruitment strength, productivity, growth and gear selectivity; all these components are required to provide science advice in support of sustainable fisheries management.","If the objectives and priorities for biological sampling are not well-matched to the requirements for Science advice then it is expected the quality of the advice will erode, creating risks to stocks and dependent fisheries from increased uncertainty in estimates of current status and future prognosis.  Articulation of priorities for biological sampling, and the requisite sampling effort is needed to (a) identify required resources and (b) anticipate resource gaps to inform strategic science and management planning.  For example, efforts to collect adequate biological samples can be rendered moot if there are, for example, insufficient fish aging resources to produce fundamental age-compositional data for stock assessment.  If Science advice is not provided, there would be an adverse impact on stakeholder-stakeholder and stakeholder-DFO relationships, particularly in an integrated fishery such as Groundfish. There is also the potential for continued negative attention from the media as well from First Nations groups and ENGOs.",2023-24,"March 31, 2024",Reviewing and updating the biological sampling protocols in the Groundfish fisheries is a priority to ensure appropriate sampling takes place in all fisheries and that samples can be aged in a timely manner. The majority of stock assessments rely on sampling data and the resulting management measures implemented need to be as accurate as possible with the available data. Up-to-date and appropriate biosampling protocols and resources is needed so that other requested stock assessments are able to be completed when needed.,No,,,Submit once approved by your Regional Director,,,,,,,,Pacific

In a MSE process, sustainability of harvest strategies is evaluated by simulation testing alternative management procedures against data generated by OMs that represent a range of hypotheses about uncertain stock and fishery dynamics.  The ongoing development of the Sablefish OM can serve as a framework for contexts where advice is generated by simulation-evaluation by illustrating methods for (a) identifying key uncertainties, (b) characterizing stock status, and (c) generating realistic stock and fishery monitoring data.","A Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for the commercial Sablefish fishery has been in place since 2008. The MSE is used to evaluate the conservation and fishery performance of alternative management procedures (MP) relative to specific measurable objectives. Since 2011, sustainable catch levels have for Sablefish in BC been determined using simulation-tested MPs.The MSE follows a 3-5 year update cycle; as part of each update the OM, last updated in 2019, is revised to be consistent with most recent data and hypotheses about Sablefish stock dynamics and fishing effects. This request is in support of a revision of the OM to (a) improve estimation of uncertainty of leading management parameters, (b) admit new hypotheses for Sablefish population dynamics, (c) characterize stock status in support of legal obligations of the new Fish Stocks provisions of the Fisheries Act and Precautionary Approach Policy requirements for the year 2023.  The request also supports provision of advice using the current MP, as well establishing the basis for simulation-evaluation of the current MP and alternatives planned for fiscal 2023/24.  A comparison of new OM characteristics with those of the 2019 OM is anticipated to evaluate changes to productivity estimates, stock scale and hence biological reference points.Specific questions to be addressed as part of this update include:- How do estimated productivity, sustainable fishing rates, and stock status change with the inclusion of four additional years of data?   - How does the introduction of fish movement into the operating model, specifically movement in between inshore and offshore zones, change estimated productivity, sustainable fishing rates, and stock status?  - Are operating model estimates of key parameters using the new software consistent with the previous approaches?  Does the operating model predict responses to the current Sablefish MP that are consistent with the previous approach?  ","Kendra Holt, Sablefish Scientist, StAR, DFO Science","MSE outputs for Sablefish are used to (i) inform decisions about a long-term harvest strategy, (ii) evaluate the likely trade-offs among conservation, yield and inter-annual variability in yield, (iii) provide a consistent and transparent procedure for determining annual harvest advice, and (iv) understand how changes in management and regulations impact the ability of alternative harvest strategies to meet Sablefish conservation and fishery objectives.This request for revision of the Sablefish OM is part of the update cycle for the Sablefish MSE.  CSAS reviews are in two steps (OM revision and MP evaluation) to reduce the amount of information reviewed at each step and allow time for reviewer comments to be integrated into each successive step.Updated estimates of stock status will be summarized in a format that supports reporting requirements under the DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework as well as the Fish Stock provisions in the Fisheries Act","The current MP reviewed in 2019 can provide catch advice through 2023/24 unless exceptional circumstances are encountered.  However, new stock and fishery monitoring data or new hypotheses during that period can lead to improved characterization of MP performance based on simulation-evaluation, which may lead to alternative MPs being selected. For example, an above average Sablefish year class occurred in 2015 and is now entering the groundfish fisheries.  As information on that year class accrues, estimate of stock productivity and reference points may also change.   Furthermore, Sablefish is currently a “batch 1” stock under the Fish Stock provisions.  An updated estimate of stock status will be helpful to support prescription of Sablefish under the provisions.

In particular, considerable attention has focused on the development of harvest control rules that strike a balance between precautionary harvest management to conserve and rebuild stocks of concern while providing sustainable harvest opportunities for more abundant co-migrating populations.  To help address these concerns, the Fraser River Sockeye Spawning Initiative was begun in 2006 and led to the development of abundance based harvest decision rules for the 4 management units: Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late.  However, there have been annual variations in the harvest rules employed by managers and the results of this new approach have not been formally assessed.

Estimation of the fishing impacts in the Fraser River, Canadian marine, and US fisheries is necessary for commitments identified in the Pacific Salmon Treaty 2019 Agreement, Salmon Integrated Fishery Management Plans, and scientific assessments such as risk analyses. IFC exploitation rates have been estimated via different approaches for US, Canadian ocean, and Fraser River fisheries since 1975.  The calculation of IFC exploitation rates relies on data for spawner escapement (IFC and Lower Fraser Coho (LFC)), ocean fishery impacts, Fraser River fishery mortalities, and the escapement of Lower Fraser Coho. Currently, the latter is not estimated but it has been identified by the PSC Coho Technical Committee as the current highest priority information that is needed to estimate IFC exploitation rates, because the IFC exploitation rates are sensitive to the LFC escapement estimate when the FRAM is used to generate exploitation rates. This project focuses on the estimation of Fraser River fishery mortalities of IFC.  Since 2001, IFC mortalities in the Fraser River were based on (1) a model predicting stock composition, called the Fraser River Decay Model; (2) estimates of kept and released Coho by fishery; and, (3) incidental mortality rates by fishery. ",Chuck Parken,"This project will review the data sources, methods and procedures used to estimate Interior Fraser Coho (IFC) Management Unit mortalities in the Fraser River, including the Fraser River Decay Model, estimation of kept and released Coho in Fraser River fisheries and the associated incidental mortality rates.   The Decay Model predicts the daily stock composition (percent IFC), which is multiplied by estimates of kept or released Coho in fisheries and the corresponding mortality rates to produce estimates of IFC mortalities. The mortalities are summed across fisheries and days to generate an annual estimate of the total post-season mortalities of IFC in Fraser River fisheries.  This project will produce updated estimates of IFC mortalities in Fraser River fisheries for 2001 to 2018, and potentially 2019 depending on data availability.  These estimates will be used by the PSC Coho Technical Committee, and DFO groups working on Southern BC Coho in SCA, FIA, and regional Science and Fisheries Management.","Due to the importance of IFC exploitation rates for planning fisheries and scientific assessment, several CSAS reviews, before 2015,  expressed concerns that the approaches used to estimate exploitation rate for the Fraser River fisheries had not undergone scientific peer review.  Science advice on this activity began in 2015, and the updated Decay Model has been used since, however fisher-independent catch estimates and update incidental mortality estimates have not been applied.  The absence of science advice has not had an identifiable negative effect on the species, habitats or ecosystems.  The PSC Coho Technical Committee has identified that a larger source of error for IFC exploitation rates is the absence of a comprehensive escapement estimation program for the LFC MU, and they have identified that gap as the highest priority for IFC exploitation rates.",2022-23,"March 31, 2023",This information is critical to the negotiation between Canada and the US on a Harvest Management agreement.

The Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) lower biological benchmark allows for substantial buffer between it and the level of abundance at which the stock would be considered at risk of extinction.  The upper biological benchmark “identifies whether harvests are greater than the level expected to provide on an average annual basis, the maximum annual catch for a CU, given existing conditions…there would not be a high probability of losing the CU”.  For stocks with stock-recruit data, the recommended upper and lower benchmarks are SGEN and .8 SMSY, respectively.  WSP biological benchmarks are defined at the Conservation Unit, or CU, scale.Under the PA, the stock limit reference point (LRP) is a biologically-defined reference that represents the status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock.  LRPs are defined at the Stock Management Unit, or SMU, scale and will be required for implementation of Bill C-68.Under the PA, the upper stock reference (USR) delimits the ‘cautious’ and ‘critical’ zones and is not strictly dependent on biological evaluation (i.e. setting the USR also involve socio-economic decisions similar to setting rebuilding targets or rebuilding exploitation rates.)   However, Science can help ‘managers’ and stakeholders set these objectives by providing results of simulation studies that evaluate the potential effect of alternate exploitation rates on stock abundance.Specific questions to be addressed include: 1. What limit-reference points (LRPs) would be recommended for Fraser River Chinook stock management units (SMUs) that are consistent with the Wild Salmon Policy (i.e. conserving biodiversity and ecosystem integrity by maintaining conservation units(CUs))?   (Note these LRPs should also be measurable within the current assessment framework and take into account uncertainty and risk.)2. What methods and associated values could be considered to support setting SMU-level USRs for Fraser River Chinook SMUs?  3. Given uncertainty in WSP habitat-based benchmarks for Fraser River Chinook, how well do they perform against stock-recruit benchmarks accounting for uncertainties and possible biases in spawner abundances, catches, recruitment estimates and age-at-maturity? 4. How would these targets taken into account, or be adjusted for, stock age and sex composition to account for differential egg production ?5. What is the effect of the following exploitation rate scenarios on Fraser River Chinook SMU abundance in relation to the recommended LRPs and USRs?Scenario 1:  Exploitation rate is limited to CYER limits set out in PST Chapter 3 for Fraser SMUs – i.e. 95% - 100% avg. 09 – 15 ER.Scenario 2: Increase exploitation rate relative to Scenario 1 by 50%.Scenario 3.  Reduce exploitation rate relative to Scenario 1 by 50%.  Scenario 4:  TMIN harvest control rule.  Limit exploitation rate to 5% or less. ",Chuck Parken,"Among other suggestions, a recent CSAS (2019) review of the Fraser River Chinook management approach recommended that: ? “Clearly-defined and measurable stock and fishery objectives for stream-type Fraser Chinook salmon should be developed to guide future management responses….  While data-limitations for stream-type Fraser Chinook make the development of biologically-based benchmarks and rebuilding goals more challenging, this work is needed to support anticipated new rebuilding regulations under Bill C-68 and DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework.  Given data limitations, habitat-based (Parken et al. 2006) or percentile-based benchmarks (Holt et al. 2018) could be considered.  If rebuilding objectives were more clearly defined, the overall assessment and decision-making process would allow for more objective and transparent evaluation of the impact of relatively small fishery impacts, such as culturally important Fraser River First Nation ‘first fish’ fisheries.”And that:• “Closed-loop feedback simulations… could be used to support rebuilding efforts for these stocks by providing insights into the impacts of various harvest strategies on the probability of achieving rebuilding goals.”The evaluation requested would provide information to address those recommendations building on work that has already been done:• Provisional CU WSP benchmarks for Fraser Chinook CUs have been used to inform the COSEWIC process based on a Chinook ‘carrying capacity model’ that relates watershed area with carrying capacity (i.e. applying Parken et al. 2006).  However, the performance of this method has not been fully evaluated accounting for uncertainties in the data and harvest risk.• SMSY escapement targets were developed under the PST process for the Fraser Summer 41  and Fraser Late SMUs.• A simulation model to evaluate the effect of exploitation on rebuilding time was developed by C. Holt and C. Freshwater as part of a SPIRA project.  Although specific rebuilding targets have not been established for Fraser Chinook, this simulation tool could be used to evaluate the effect of alternate harvest strategies on stock abundance in relation to biological benchmarks, LRPs and USRs.  The results would help inform the discussion to develop rebuilding targets.The additional work under this RSIA involves:• Evaluating the performance of Fraser River Chinook WSP benchmarks developed using habitat carrying capacity model.• Recommending LRP for Fraser SMUs that consider CU diversity.  Such LRPs may build from CU WSP benchmarks.• Applying simulation tools to evaluate the effect of alternate harvest scenarios on SMU abundance in relation to recommended LRP and potential USRs such as .8 SMSY – notwithstanding diversity of CU productivity.","There is considerable concern being raised by First Nations and stakeholders about the Department's current management approach for Fraser River chinook stocks and whether management actions are achieving conservation objectives and intended fishery impact reductions by sector (i.e. First Nations, recreational and commercial).

As part of a Rockfish Conservation Strategy launched by DFO in 2002,  Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs), a spatial management measure, were proposed to reduce the fishing mortality on inshore rockfish, in concert with reductions to commercial fishery catch quotas, recreational fishery bag limits, and improvements to both catch monitoring and assessment.  In 2007, a suite of 164 RCAs were implemented which closed fisheries to maintain a near-zero fishing mortality for inshore rockfish species and fulfill the targeted closure of up to 30% of rockfish habitat within inside waters and 20% of habitats in the outside areas.  Since 2011, there has not been a monitoring program in place to assess the stock status of inshore rockfish and their habitats within and adjacent to RCAs.  In light of DFO's commitment to manage fisheries (under Sustainable Fisheries Framework and Precautionary Approach) and benthic areas (Sensitive Benthic Areas) Ecosystem and Fishery managers are requesting the development of a framework to monitor RCAs with the goal of assessing their ongoing effectiveness, if any, and identifying any improvements required to the existing RCA management to achieve the initial goal of halting the decline of inshore rockfish and promoting their sustainability.     In addition to monitoring fish populations, it is also important to include evaluating quality of habitats in RCAs, monitoring habitat impacts from allowable activities, and collecting habitat data to improve habitat suitability models that can be used to assess the prevalence, quality and degree of patchiness of rockfish habitat in RCAs.",Dana HaggartySarah Dudas,"This information will be used to make future management decisions regarding Rockfish Conservation Areas - responding potentially to the impact of activities currently allowed within the RCAs and the effectiveness of RCAs as they are currently managed. This project will contribute to the body of scientific information used to rationalize adjustments made to harvest practices permitted within RCAs (if deemed necessary) to enable RCAs to qualify under the Marine Conservation Target OECM category, in support of the commitments made by Canada to increasing the conservation of Canada’s oceans to 25 per cent by 2025, working towards 30 per cent by 2030.By ensuring that RCAs are managed effectively in the long term, this project will bring DFO closer to an ecosystem approach to management and result in refuge areas for multiple inshore rockfish species.","If RCAs are not monitored, Fisheries Management won't know if the activities permitted in the closures are impacting rockfish habitat and the recruitment capability of rockfish within the RCAs.  An effective long term monitoring plan is required to ensure RCAs are providing the conservation benefits necessary to rebuild and sustain inshore rockfsh populations. Stakeholders including the commercial fishing sector and ENGOs, are very interested in the ""Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures"" (OECM) category of the Marine Conservation Target initiative.  RCAs represent the largest permanent area-based conservation closure in Pacific Region.  The public will be very interested in knowing how we are managing these closures and whether or not they qualify under this category.",2022-23,"March 31, 2023","Work currently in progress regarding RCA boundary changes will be beginning soon for the Strait of Georgia with discussions underway for the Northern Shelf Bioregion.

What are the impacts of  proposed new spatially explicit protections in the NSB MPAn on current science advice? How should these protections be considered in future stock assessments and harvest management control measures across fisheries in the Pacific Region (e.g. required changes to survey design due to potential prohibitions in protected areas, adjustments to management control measures such as TAC and/or effort distribution)?

An monitoring framework and effective long term monitoring plan are required to ensure that that these marine refuges are providing the conservation benefits necessary to protect and support glass sponge reefs, species (like rockfish) who depend on them, and the ecosystem services they provide (water filtration, carbon & nitrogen processing, etc.). Additionally, given the high profile of Howe Sound among citizens and environmental groups, lack of monitoring may result in negative media attention if the marine refuges are put in place without the tools needed to ensure they are effective. In past consultations for glass sponge reef marine refuges and Rockfish Conservation Areas, monitoring (along with enforcement) has been consistently raised by stakeholders as a critical issue that needs to be addressed to effectively achieve conservation objectives and to prevent the creation of 'paper parks'.
