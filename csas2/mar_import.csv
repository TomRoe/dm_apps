",No,"FFHPP staff willing to work with DFO Science to further refine questions, as needed. ","FFHPP is responsible for the regulatory review of works, undertakings or activities under the Fisheries Act and Species at Risk Act. The Policy Statement for Fish and Fish Habitat Protection emphasizes that efforts should be made to first prevent (avoid) the occurrence of harmful impacts (including death of fish) on fish and fish habitat. When avoidance is not possible, then efforts should be made to minimize (mitigate) impacts. Finally any residual impacts should then be addressed by offsetting. FFHPP is currently in discussions with Nova Scotia Power, Inc. on the development of Fisheries Management Objectives for the Black River Hydro System in Nova Scotia with the goal of advising conditions for a Fisheries Act authorization for the system that would include Death of Fish and offsetting requirements where applicable. 

FFHPP will use the scientific advice to inform offsetting measures for death of iBoF Atlantic Salmon in iBoF rivers in Nova Scotia, including potential Fisheries Act authorization for Black River Hydro System.  This advice could also be used by other DFO Regions during the review of similar projects for endangered species.","If science advice is not provided, FFHPP will proceed with project Authorization and offsetting decisions on a case-by-case basis and likely through less formal collaborations with other DFO sectors.

Framework and Stock Assessment for Inshore Herring (Gillnet and weir fisheries) and Offshore Scotian Shelf ,Christa.Waters@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,Maritimes ,Resource Management,No,,"Framework assessment and full stock assessment for Inshore Herring and Offshore Scotian Shelf including establishing reference point(s) where possible (Little Hope and Eastern Shore).

Review and evaluate biological and fishery information of herring in these areas. Advice is for confirming the annual quota for the fishery, as required in the Integrated Fisheries Management Plan including (but not limited to):

• An evaluation and development of the indicators for the inshore spawning components.
• A compilation and review of information regarding the offshore Scotian Shelf spawning component and the coastal Nova Scotia spawning component.

• Update and framework assessment on southwest New Brunswick migrant juvenile fishery component.


",Yes,Allan Debertin,"The information will be used by Resource Management to know the health of the stock and to inform decisions on TAC and management measures for the fishery.

It will also be presented to Advisory Committees whose members include harvesters, processors, other governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations. The scientific recommendations that are made based on the background information will impact the economic return to local communities dependent on the resource.

The intended end users of the information and advice will be DFO resource management and the herring fishing and processing industries. DFO and other governmental agencies will use the data. Academic researchers and ENGOs could use the data.  

Herring is a forage species and is part of the food web of several predators in the ecosystem. This request relates to the objective of conserving the productivity of this resource and its role in the ecosystem. Other specific ecosystem considerations include: what effect does primary productivity and oceanographic conditions have on the productivity of the species? How might we better account for the ecosystem role of herring in our science advice and management decision-making?","If advice is not provided, the harvest level in will have to be based on the most recent data available. Using older information may result in an over- or under-exploitation of the stock (with associated economic or conservation implications). Since many herring stocks in the Atlantic are showing productivity declines or in the critical zone, updated information on current stock status and trends is important to ensure appropriate management action is taken to limit the risk of falling into the critical zone. Lack of new science advice would also likely lead to negative feedback from industry, ENGOs, and possibly other stakeholders.",7/1/2021,The bulk of fishing effort starts in August and proceeds through to October.

A commitment to answer the question about ASO levels was included in the regionally-approved Cusk AAP to support the DNL under SARA recommendation, and a similar commitment is likely to get included in the AAP for White hake as well. In addition, it is anticipated that Winter skate may be recommended for listing under SARA and our ability to effectively monitor bycatch of this species will be an important component of implementing SARA requirement for this species.

In addition to SARA DNL and list considerations for these species, there is concern that cod is being discarded and that landings data do not accurately depict fishing mortality. 4X5Y cod is in the critical zone and is anticipated to be listed on Batch 2 of the Fish Stock Provisions.    
 
This request relates to the biodiversity objective of the EAM Framework to control unintended incidental mortality. 

DFO is beginning to implement the Fishery Monitoring Policy (FMP) at the operational level. This request supports the application of the policy and will also inform management decisions related to the deployment of observers in the fishery.  One of the objectives of the policy is to have dependable, timely and accessible fishery information necessary to help ensure that Canadian fisheries are managed to support the sustainable harvest of aquatic species. 

A review of the observer coverage levels in the 4VWX5 groundfish fishery (and at fleet levels) as proposed will assist in the implementation of the FMP policy in the fishery in two primary ways:
• It will provide timely, dependable information related to the ability of current observer coverage levels to provide sufficient information to allow for an assessment of estimated bycatch of depleted species.   
• It will provide an assessment which will allow resource managers to, if and where required, amend, increase or shift at-sea observer resources to ensure they are sufficient to provide estimates of bycatch for each of the species noted as a priority.   

","If advice on sufficient levels of ASO coverage to monitor these depleted species is not provided, it will remain uncertain whether we have adequate information to accurately assess the level of risk fisheries bycatch is posing to these COSEWIC-assessed, depleted species, and also uncertain whether current management measures (e.g., quota caps, trip limits) are sufficient to address this risk. This situation is inconsistent with the Departmental priority of protection of COSEWIC-assessed or depleted species, and addressing this knowledge gap has been identified as a commitment during multiple groundfish SARA listing processes. The Department will be expected to report against this commitment and our Departmental priorities for depleted species in the coming years, and determining whether current ASO levels are sufficient (and if not, what sufficient levels would be) is the necessary first step on which future management decisions for these species should be based.

Assessment of Atlantic Wolffish population trends in the Maritimes Region,paige.crowell@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,Maritimes ,Species at Risk Program,No,"Atlantic Wolffish occurs in Maritimes, Gulf, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador regions; however, this request addresses only the Scotian Shelf portion of the population.  ","Atlantic Wolffish (Special Concern) underwent steep declines in both abundance and area of occupancy over much of its range from the 1980s until the mid 1990s. Research vessel surveys (NAFO areas 4X & 4VW) suggest that abundance continued to decline on the Scotian Shelf in the 2000s and remains at low levels. However, numerous factors make it difficult to confidently assess trends within the population. These include the historically low distribution and abundance of the species on the Scotian Shelf compared to Newfoundland and Labrador, life history traits (e.g. habitat preference/hyperdepletion), shifting environmental conditions, and variables within the RV survey itself (e.g. gear type/catchability, survey area). 

With the data sources available (e.g. Fisheries Observer data, SARA logbooks, other DFO surveys, industry data), is it possible to develop a reliable biomass index for the Scotian Shelf portion of the population? Can the index be used to understand population trends over time? Can the index be used to assess and track fishing mortality over time? What does the data reveal about species distribution patterns? What does the data reveal about potential drivers of population decline, range shifts, and/or sustained low abundances?

The public comment period for the Proposed NARW Action Plan exposed widespread concerns that DFO is basing management decisions on outdated documents (i.e., RPA (2007), recovery strategy (2009; 2014)) and there were multiple questions posed about potential critical habitat in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Certain key portions of the recovery strategy are informed directly by the RPA, therefore an updated RPA is required. It is possible that only certain elements of the RPA TORs will be required - this will be subject to analysis and discussion between SARP and Science.

The advice generated from the RPA may also be used to inform other DFO management decisions, including the issuance of SARA permits. It may also help to identify further research needs.

The end users of the advice will be the Species at Risk Program (SARP) in Maritimes Region (lead Region) and the supporting Regions (Gulf, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador), as well as National Headquarters. Other DFO sectors/programs (e.g., Resource Management, Conservation and Protection; Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program; Oceans Program) & other federal departments (e.g., Transport Canada) may also use the information in the regulation and management of threats and activities that impact NARW. ","SARA recovery strategies are science-based and prepared using the best available information. Overall, the RPA is relied upon heavily when preparing recovery strategies. Indeed, SARP guidance documents for the preparation of recovery strategies provide direction that certain components of the recovery strategy are to come directly from the RPA.  Given NARW is one of the most high profile SARA-listed species, having a recovery strategy based on robust peer-reviewed science advice seems particularly warranted. Without an updated RPA, it will be challenging to update the existing, outdated, recovery strategy; and, any updates that are made will be more subject to scrutiny and open to challenge. This could affect efforts to protect and recover the species.

Since the 2017 mortality event in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the release of the preliminary 2019 population estimates by NOAA (366 individuals remaining) there has been significant media, government, stakeholder, NGO, and public interest in this species and scrutiny of all relevant management measures. During the public comment period for the Proposed Action Plan for the species, there were widespread concerns about the Government of Canada basing its management decisions on outdated documents (i.e., RPA, RS), and questions about potential critical habitat in the Gulf of St. Lawrence with the apparent distributional shift into that region.

","In Nova Scotia a total area of 33,000 hectares of tidal land is protected from saltwater by a series of dykes and over 100 tidal gate structures / aboiteaus, which allow the release of freshwater but prevent or restrict the inflow of seawater during the flood tide. Many of these historic structures were built on natural rivers (e.g., Avon River, Halfway River, LaPlanche, etc.) and result in impacts to fish passage. Climate change and sea level rise has placed increasing attention on flood control structures and their maintenance/replacement. 

DFO's Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program (FFHPP) has been increasingly asked to review replacements, upgrades, and operations of these tidal gate / aboiteau structures with the goal of increasing fish passage. Given the uncertainty about the potential impacts of tidal control / aboiteau structures, having information on the effectiveness of fish passage structures is essential for supporting science-based decision-making, verifying compliance with the Fisheries Act and Species at Risk Act, and increasing DFO's knowledge and understanding of the potential effects of these structures.

The work is likely being carried out to develop methods to screen elvers and/or large eel for the swim bladder parasite in an effort to repatriate eel above the Mactaquac Dam to facilitate a food, social, and ceremonial fishery. The above noted research is being undertaken with an assumption that the parasite is not present above the dam. It is likely that DFO will receive a request in the future to stock eel above that dam that have been screened for the parasite.

Is the swim bladder parasite currently present in American eel that are found above the Mactaquac Dam?",No,,"Advice will be used to inform discussions with groups who are working on developing methods to potentially repatriate eels above the Mactaquac Dam. 

Confirming the presence or absence of the swim bladder parasite in American eel above the dam will allow DFO to provide advice and guidance to groups that may significantly change their current approach. 
","While it is currently unknown if the swim bladder parasite is found above the dam, DFO is aware of research and work currently being carried out with an objective that may not ultimately be supported and approved by DFO.

Validation of the Canadian Marine Invasive Screening Tool (CMIST) for use in freshwater ,sarah.kingsbury@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,Maritimes ,Aquatic Invasive Species National Core Program,Yes,"Yes, the validation and use of the Canadian Marine Invasive Screening Tool (CMIST) for freshwater species (CFIST) could be a useful tool for all regions. ","The Canadian Marine Invasive Screening Tool (CMIST) is a screening-level risk assessment tool for marine invasive species. It is a questionnaire that follows the invasion process from arrival to impact and is designed so an informed assessor can quickly evaluate one species in an assessment area using easily accessible information from databases, primary and grey literature. The CMIST was developed through a previous CSAS process. The AIS National Core Program - Maritimes Region is interested in Science advice on the applicability of the tool in freshwater environments, specifically: 
-does the Canadian Marine Invasive Screening Tool (CMIST) provide valid risk assessments for freshwater species? 
-is there a need for a separate Canadian Freshwater Invasive Screening Tool (CFIST)? If so, how would CMIST and CFIST differ?",No,,"In order to prioritize management actions and support evidence-based decision making, the AIS-NCP needs to know the relative risks associated with freshwater species. CMIST can provide such risk assessments for marine species and has been reportedly used for freshwater AIS. However, the results are not publicly available, nor have the amendments for using CMIST for freshwater (noted in the CMIST user manual) been made available. Therefore, a CMIST developed methodology validated for freshwater AIS would be very beneficial for regulatory purposes. Also, having a CMIST re-advertised as CFIST, Canadian Freshwater Invasive Screening Tool, with notes on the validated use of the modified CMIST methods would decrease confusion about whether or not CMIST can be used for freshwater AIS. ","If the science advice is not provided, groups, organizations, and the provincial governments applying to enact a management plan for a freshwater AIS may be confused about the process and the validity of the CMIST. This may result in these organizations either paying for an environmental consultant to conduct a risk assessment, using methods that have not been validated by DFO, or to drop the project all together due to a confusing process.   ",3/31/2022,"AIS National Core Program - Maritimes Region is in the process of developing AIS response plans that will help facilitate AIS management projects, including for freshwater AIS. The draft freshwater AIS response plans propose that partners will need to complete a risk assessment using CMIST.

What are the decision points and levels that determine that the risk to the wild population is too high?  

",Yes,DFO Maritimes Science Staff,"Aquaculture management is part of the Minister's mandate letter, and in order to have sustainable aquaculture, more genetic information and genetic screening tools for farmed salmon is necessary to mitigate the potential risks of aquaculture to wild conspecifics.

Improved testing methods, tools and indicators will also help in the identification and traceability of salmon and whether they are wild, aquaculture or enhancement finfish. 

Better tools will also inform the Introductions and Transfers Committees to evaluate the genetic risks and mitigate the impacts associated with the transfers of finfish. For example, there is a need for a genetic tool to identify Atlantic salmon with non-American genes to restrict their introduction in Atlantic Canadian waters. The tests, tools and indicators would be applicable to other regions seeking to reduce specific genetic interactions in new sites and with the introduction and transfers process.




","There is a need for science to proactively inform the aquaculture industry as it develops/evolves rapidly in the region. There is an increased interest in new finfish site development in Nova Scotia and in production increases in New Brunswick.
The Province of Nova Scotia, through its Traceability Committee, is looking for science advice to inform a new traceability program for salmon aquaculture and increased monitoring efforts.
 
The provinces of both NS and NB have indicated a strong interest in these assessment methods, tools and indicators. Finfish aquaculture is a significant socio-economic contributor to both provinces, but also can also effect other coastal industries and the health of the ecosystem.

Appropriate Science contacts are unknown, and SARP recovery biologists will only be assigned to the species if it is listed. 

NL Region may also be submitting a CSAS request for ESSN Winter Skate interactions with their Thorny Skate fishery. If feasible and if it makes sense, these requests could be combined.","The Eastern Scotian Shelf and Newfoundland Designatable Unit of Winter Skate (ESSN Winter Skate) has been assessed as endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) and is being considered for listing under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). The recovery potential assessment (SAR 2017/014) for ESSN Winter Skate identified habitat features, functions and attributes of various life stages of Winter Skate on the Eastern Scotian Shelf (i.e. egg cases, juveniles, sub-adults and adults). If listed under SARA, the identification of critical habitat for these life stages will be required. Furthermore, if listed under SARA, an allowable harm assessment would be required to inform fisheries management decisions, including informing the issuance of SARA compliant fishing licenses for bycatch and determining which activities would qualify for SARA permits and exemptions. The SAR 2017/014 did not provide an allowable harm estimate, which would be required upon listing.

The questions to be addressed include the following:
1. Can the habitat features, functions and attributes for the various life stages of ESSN Winter Skate identified in the RPA be further refined? Does data exist that was not considered/incorporated into the initial RPA? Is there new information on the biophysical functions, features, and attributes of those areas?

Methodology for estimating fishing mortality for Porbeagle,paige.crowell@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,Maritimes ,Species at Risk Program,Yes,"This would be a zonal process including Maritimes, Gulf, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador regions. Appropriate regional Science contacts (outside of Maritimes region) are unknown. Regional SARP recovery biologists will be assigned if the species is listed. 

Resource Management is also a client sector. Contact: Koren Spence, Maritimes Region. ","Fishing mortality related to bycatch is the main anthropogenic threat to Porbeagle. Porbeagle is distributed across all four eastern DFO regions, and is susceptible to bycatch during a variety of fishing activities (commercial, recreational, Food, Social, Ceremonial and/or scientific surveys). A method of estimating total annual bycatch mortality within and across regions and priority fisheries is necessary to understand and manage human impacts to Porbeagle, and to ensure that fishing mortality, from all sources, is not exceeding 185mt annually (the proposed proxy for a 4% mortality rate, which is the maximum mortality rate that will allow the population to increase (DFO 2015/048)). 

The desired outcome of this process is to establish a methodology to estimate annual mortality across fisheries and regions, which could be updated on an ongoing basis. Ideally, this methodology would answer the following questions:

- Using the best available data (e.g. observer data, commercial data, survey data), what is the estimated total commercial bycatch in the Maritimes, Gulf, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec regions, in both tonnage and number of animals?  
- What proportions of bycatch can be attributed to specific fisheries? 
- How is bycatch temporally/spatially distributed? 
- How have bycatch estimates changed over time?
- What amount of bycatch is retained?
- When bycatch is discarded, what is the estimated post-release mortality for each fishery/gear type?
- What degree of confidence do the above estimates carry? What additional data sources or studies would further this analysis? If an estimate is not possible, what degree of observer coverage would be necessary to achieve this?
- How are these questions being addressed in other jurisdictions (e.g. ICCAT, USA)? Can these methods be applied in the Canadian context?

Priority fisheries include swordfish and other tunas pelagic longline, groundfish fixed gear and mobile gear, and other fisheries as deemed relevant by Science.",Yes,"This request was submitted last year. It was not added to the schedule, but subsequent conversation with Heather Bowlby (DFO Science) confirmed that this would be feasible for completion in 2022/2023. ","Porbeagle is currently being considered for listing under SARA. Should Porbeagle be listed as endangered, this information is necessary to inform permitting decisions, with respect to meeting section 73 pre-conditions. Regardless of whether Porbeagle is listed under SARA, accurate bycatch mortality estimates are necessary to implement and monitor management measures for the species, inform fisheries management decisions and to track the recovery of the species. In particular, a method of estimating total annual fishing mortality for Porbeagle is necessary to ensure that the 185mt cap is not being exceeded, which would prevent the population from increasing.

","In the absence of this advice, outdated and potentially inaccurate/incomplete estimates of bycatch will be used as reference points in the management of Porbeagle. This could negatively affect the species if actual rates of bycatch and mortality are higher than the previously established estimates.",3/23/2023,"As stated above, should Porbeagle be listed,this information is necessary to inform permitting decisions, with respect to meeting SARA section 73 pre-conditions.

The establishment requirements for an ESA would be similar to those for an Area of Interest for Marine Protected Area establishment. The location for an ESA candidate has not yet been determined, but this request is being prepared so a future designation is not delayed due to a lack of science information and advice. The specific advice requested from Science is as follows: 

1. A biophysical and ecological overview of the area (TBD) using internal and external sources of information. Information should focus on attributes of the area that meet the ESA criteria of fish and/or fish habitat that is sensitive, highly productive, rare, or unique (criteria definitions are available). Areas that meet these criteria should be described and mapped where possible. 
2. Using the information collected, conservation priorities (species/habitats) should be identified. 
3. Identification of boundaries to capture conservation priorities and the functions, features and attributes that are required to maintain priority habitats and connectivity for priority species. 

Information is currently being collected by the Integrated Planning Unit for ESA case studies to better understand the regulations and to inform a national framework.

The questions were developed with guidance from staff in Marine Planning and Conservation considering lessons learned from similar requests for Areas of Interest for Marine Protected Area establishment.,"The information will be used to inform the development of an ESA regulation under the Fisheries Act s. 35.2(2). ESA regulations can prescribe prohibited works, undertakings, or activities (herein referred to as activities) and activities that would require an authorization under s. 35.2(7), including any conditions that must be met for the activities to be authorized. The regulations also include conservation objectives which determine how activities are regulated in the ESA.

As a first step in this process, there is a need to identify and then prioritize areas of ecological significance in freshwater environments. Application of the EBSA criteria (Ecosystem Status Report 2004/006) for identifying these areas has been recommended as the best approach, as it is consistent with what has already been done in marine and coastal environments in the Scotian Shelf Bioregion. Following this work, there will likely be a prioritization exercise of marine and coastal areas as candidate ESAs which may involve another DFO Science request. Additional requests for Science advice on threat identification and prioritization, conservation objectives, and other information pertaining to ESA identification will likely be submitted in future years.

End users of the EBSA identification exercise will primarily be the Integrated Planning Unit who will use this information to further the ESA candidate identification process (note that EBSA identification is not a critical path to ESA establishment but is the preferred approach). DFO staff administering the Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program (primarily the Regulatory Reviews Unit), the Species at Risk Program, and DFO Science will also be users of this information as it contributes to their mandates. Proponents who propose to undertake a work, undertaking, or activity will also be end users when EBSAs are identified.  It is envisioned that the Department will, in consultation with provinces, municipalities, Indigenous peoples, and others, identify potential ESAs and their conservation objectives which will inform the types and classes of works, undertakings and activities that may occur within or may be prohibited in an ESA. Although the Oceans Program does not likely benefit from the identification of freshwater EBSAs, they will benefit from future work to identify ESA candidates in marine and coastal areas that could contribute to their Marine Conservation Targets. ","If Science advice is not provided, Integrated Planning will consider publishing the work in a secondary publication (e.g., Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences). As a result, the department may receive scruitiny and there will be a lack of buy-in from external groups as a result of not having a peer-review process to validate the identification and prioritization of freshwater EBSAs. It is possible that we will seek Science review of EBSAs in individual watersheds in advance of a regional approach. ",3/31/2023,"The identification of ESAs will likely be a long process, as this is a new program and requires a national framework and policy to be developed, extensive external engagement, and an extensive regulatory development phase. The identification and prioritization of EBSAs in the freshwater realm must occur as soon as possible so this process can get started.

"The responsible use of cleaner fish in Atlantic salmon aquaculture with an emphasis on environment, genetics, and disease.",Suzanne.Dobson@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,Maritimes ,Aquaculture Management ,Yes,National Implications/Interest,"When considering the stocking of aquaculture sites, the introduction and transfer of finfish,and the identification of escapees,what is the current ecologic importance of cleaner fish, more specifically Lumpfish? What are the ecological and disease considerations in the use of cleaner fish in Aquaculture and what are the introgression implications to wild conspecifics from escaped cleaner fish?",Yes,DFO Science Staff,"There is an increased interest in new finfish site development in Nova Scotia and in New Brunswick, the use of lumpfish as a cleaner fish to reduce sealice has become the preferred method of pest control over the use of pesticides. As the use of cleaner fish becomes more prevalent, there is a need to for science advice on the resulting ecological, genetics and disease.

There is a need for science to proactively inform the aquaculture industry as it develops/evolves rapidly in the region. 

Aquaculture management is part of the Minister's mandate letter, and in order to have sustainable aquaculture, more genetic information is necessary to mitigate the potential risks of aquaculture to wild conspecifics.

","Without science advice, decisions to introduce new species of cleaner fish in the Maritime regions to support aquaculture development is continuing without proper consideration or assessment. This may lead to the inadvertent introduction of a different species of fish with the potential to genetically alter the other fish in the new area or harm the existing environment. 

The planned movement of live aquatic organisms is regulated by the National Code on Introductions and Transfers of Aquatic Organisms which provides the process for assessing potential impacts of moving the organisms from one body of water or facility to another. This process enables each jurisdiction to work with applicants to minimize the risks of altering the genetic make-up of native species as well as limiting the spread of diseases and other potentially negative impacts on the ecosystem. DFO administers the Code under the Fishery Regulations and issues licences to authorize the intentional release and transfer of live aquatic organisms. ",3/31/2023,"The department is currently developing new regulations, new Canada-wide standards (with provincial regulatory partners) and a new Aquaculture Act.  The Directorate requires science advice to assist in the development of these legislative and regulatory vehicles as they pertain to the use of cleaner fish to effectively manage all significant interactions between aquaculture operations and the environment to ensure long term sustainability.

Development of eDNA monitoring indicators for MPA monitoring in Maritimes Region,derek.fenton@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,Maritimes ,Marine Planning and Conservation,No,"May evolve to include other regions, depending on interest and whether data collection is occurring or planned in other areas","Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a promising tool to collect information on the biodiversity of the marine environment in a non-invasive manner. Preliminary eDNA sampling began in the Maritimes region in 2019, with samples being collected, or planning to be collected, in all the MPAs in the region. The focus of this work is to evaluate the application of eDNA as a biodiversity monitoring approach. Ultimately this work will support the application of eDNA for biodiversity monitoring; however indicators identified in the established monitoring frameworks for each MPA were not conceived with eDNA in mind and thus linkages remain general at this time.

Further advice is required to develop specific indicators supported by the collection of eDNA that serve the conservation objectives of each MPA and the regional conservation network. As a relatively new science, advice is also required on how eDNA sampling designs should be implemented in each MPA (e.g., structured approach to inform spatial-temporal aspects of the survey design). This advice will help confirm and detail the use of this tool for biodiversity monitoring and help develop a long-term plan around its future collection. Therefore, the overarching questions are ""Is eDNA a useful tool to monitor biodiversity for each MPA in Maritimes Region"".

In support of this,information gaps and recommendations were provided to guide future work on EBSA identification within the Lake. Since then, Hastings et al.,(2014)identified the entirety of the Bras d'Or Lakes inland sea as an EBSA; however, additional work is required to delineate important and sensitive sub-EBSA areas within the Lakes for consideration in bioregional conservation network planning and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) initiatives. 
 
Since the available western science traditional knowledge was compiled and assessed in Parker et al., (2007), DFO science,the Unama'ki Institute of Natural Resources, esearchers from academic institutions such as Cape Breton University, and the Bras d'Or Lakes Biosphere reserve have continued to conduct research and monitoring activities in the Lakes. Likewise, over a decade of Mi'kmaq Ecological knowledge has been gained. An update to Parker et al., (2007)is therefore warranted.

Establishing a Risk-Based Shellfish Environmental Monitoring Program,Suzanne.Dobson@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,Maritimes ,Aquaculture Management ,Yes,National Implications/Interest,"In support of the development of a risk-based shellfish environmental monitoring program and evidence-based decision-making, science advice is required on monitoring designs for detecting localized and ecosystem impacts from shellfish aquaculture sites.
1.  What level of shellfish production is likely to result in benthic and/or pelagic effects to fish and fish habitat that are significant enough to require management actions?
2.  What tools are available to predict when monitoring is appropriate for evaluating those effects?
3.  What indicators are available to monitor for those effects?
The management objectives for a shellfish environmental monitoring program include: protection of the benthic environment from shellfish aquaculture organic deposition such that a productive benthic community is maintained; ensuring that existing naturally occurring shellfish populations are not negatively impacted by reduced food availability due to the shellfish aquaculture activities; (any others?) Advice on the risk-based factors and thresholds for local and bay-scale monitoring is also sought.
",Yes,"Ingrid Burgetz, National Manager, Aquaculture Regulatory Sciences
Scott Pilcher, Senior Science Advisor, Aquaculture Regulatory Sciences","Having the ability to determine localized and ecosystem impacts from shellfish aquaculture sites on the benthic and pelagic environments will help the Department offer more strategic, evidence-based advice to the provinces on potential new or expanding sites. 

Aquaculture management is part of the Minister's mandate letter, and in order to have sustainable shellfish aquaculture, more information is needed on what information should be required from proponents as part of a shellfish monitoring program.","Canada is committed under the UN FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing to ensure that aquaculture is appropriately managed to protect the aquatic environment.    

The province of NS has indicated a strong interest in creating an environmental monitoring program for shellfish aquaculture operations. There is a general concern among coastal user of the impacts of aquaculture on the environment. The ability to monitor those impacts will significantly improve the ability to communicate about the management of impacts from shellfish aquaculture. 

The Department is responsible for overseeing aquaculture operations nationally through the Aquaculture Activity Regulations (AARs). Currently, there is no environmental monitoring program for shellfish operations despite the fact that organic deposition from the shellfish could have effects on benthic and pelagic habitats.  As this advice will support the development of a monitoring program that is linked to the likelihood of effects,  a lack of this advice would result in the potential imposition of monitoring requirements that are unnecessary to ensure the sustainable management of the industry, or a continued lack of monitoring requirements altogether. ",3/31/2024,"The department is currently developing new regulations, new Canada-wide standards (with provincial regulatory partners) and a new Aquaculture Act.  The Directorate requires this crucial advice to assist in the complete development of these legislative and regulatory vehicles to effectively manage all significant interactions between aquaculture operations and the environment to ensure long term sustainability.

Update of Stock Status Indicators for the SWNB Sea Cucumber Fishery in Maritimes Region,kathryn.cooper-macdonald@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,Maritimes ,Resource Management,No,,"For the sea cucumber fishery in Southwest New Brunswick, advice is requested for the following:
- Update to the stock status indicators (split-weight indicator and catch rate indicators [kg/m2 and kg/hr*m])
- The reliability of current stock status indicators
- The adequacy of data collection and reporting methods for these indicators
- The reasonableness of conclusions drawn by the industry in their indicator reports
- Review of any survey data and potential for updating indicator approach using this data
- Additional and/or alternative data sources for monitoring stock status (e.g., the snow crab survey)
- Is there evidence of any conservation risks for this fishery? Is there critical information that needs to be collected to determine if there is a conservation risk?",Yes,"Michelle Greenlaw, Melanie Barrett",The advice will be used by Resource Management to make improvements to minimum monitoring and reporting requirements in the fishery.  It will also be used to inform decisions about total allowable catches.,"If advice is not provided, the interim informal updates on this stock will be used for the management of the fishery.  These, and the manner in which they are reported on, will have had little independent scrutiny and will not have been peer reviewed.

"Review of stock status of Scotian Shelf Sea Cucumber and Advice on Rotational Fishing, Including an Update on Reserve Guidance and Evaluating the use of Camera Surveys to Estimate Biomass. ",kathryn.cooper-macdonald@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,Maritimes ,Resource Management,No,,"Sea Cucumber are vulnerable to over-exploitation and serial depletion.  In the Maritimes Region, sustainable exploitation levels are unknown. An approach for setting reference points was developed in a 2019 CSAS Process, as well as guidance for establishing reserves in fishing areas. Licence holders in both 4W Offshore and 4VS, have been working towards setting up rotational harvest strategies, with the inclusion of reserves based on this guidance. The Department has not been able to comment or provide guidance on a rotational approach, and Industry is working to set their fishing areas up to allow for rotation and reserves. 

Questions to answer - 

What is the stock status of Sea Cucumber in the various fishing areas of the Scotian Shelf?

Provision of Guidance for Rotational Harvesting in the Scotian Shelf Sea Cucumber Fishery. 

Licence holders have been working with Industry Scientist and Academic Institutions to identify an approach for estimating Biomass using Camera Surveys - A Review of this approach is requested. 

Licence holders have proposed using exploitation rates based on biomass estimates from the camera surveys to determine appropriate harvest levels from specific areas. Can DFO Science recommend an appropriate exploitation rate for Sea Cucumber Harvest on the Scotian Shelf and validate whether the camera survey method is appropriate?  

Reserve guidance established for different areas on the Scotian Shelf should be reviewed and re-assigned if required. 



",Yes,Melanie Barrett,"The advice will be used by Resource Management to make improvements to management of the Sea Cucumber Fishery on the Scotian Shelf, understanding that this is a Secondary Fishery where we ask Industry to provide Science. The Scientific approaches they are providing should be reviewed and validated.  It will also be used to inform decisions about total allowable catches.","If advice is not provided, areas for which we have identified reference points, that have been in decline may be further depleted without management changes. Considering the Scotian Shelf Area, there is potential to set up better ways to manage and continue building on approaches that are working in some of the fishing areas. Working with industry to employ approaches they are suggesting and validating them through the CSAS process is appropriate to move forward. Without allowing changes to the fishing areas to address the concerns with the species (Sea cucumber is vulnerable to over-exploitation and serial depletion, and therefore significant risks exist for the sea cucumber populations. Economic and Socioeconomic impacts to Industry and the communities for which they employ staff will be impacted. 

If advice is not provided, the interim informal updates on this stock will be used for the management of the fishery.  These, and the manner in which they are reported on, will have had little independent scrutiny and will not have been peer reviewed.",3/
