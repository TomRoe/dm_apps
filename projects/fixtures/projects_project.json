It is important that changes in maturity are accounted for to correctly estimate spawning stock biomass.

This approach avoid separate climate downscaling configurations for separate specific sub-domain areas like the Gulf of St Lawrence, Newfoundland Shelf or Gulf of Maine, and with a single simulation configuration, all the simulations can be performed for the selected climate change scenarios.

In recent years, <span class=\"caps\">DFO</span> conducts approximately 60 sites throughout the watershed with an aim to conduct at least four sites on main tributaries. Electrofishing sites are a combination of barriered sites (n=5) and open sites (n=55). Generally, an electrofishing crew for this program consists of three members: a leader with the backpack electrofishing unit, a member catching shocked fish with a lip seine, and a member catching and carrying the shocked fish. With normal water conditions, this is a five week program that usually starts the last week of August and ends at the end of September. The Miramichi electrofishing program relies heavily on the Miramichi Salmon Association who has provided two crew members annually for many years.  The fish and habitat data collected from the survey are entered into databases and verified by <span class=\"caps\">DFO</span> staff in Miramichi. Scales from the survey are also mounted and read by Miramichi staff. Analysis of the data is conducted by Miramichi staff and included in stock status assessments, advice to managers, and shared with user groups in a variety of reports and presentations. Additional comments: 1. The cost of this program is higher than what is identified here. The Miramichi electrofishing program occurs separately but simultaneously with the Miramichi Index Trapnet program. This means that Moncton staff are often required to backfill staff required for the trapnets during September which requires the use of an additional truck, incurs travel expenses and sometimes overtime. Further, the time required to check and validate the backpack electrofishers (traditionally R\u00e9jean V.) is not reflected here. 2.

These provide the foundation for stock assessments of commercial species and recovery potential assessments of species-at-risk.  These assessments are required to provide science advice to managers, with an emphasis on quantifying uncertainty and risk.  An additional component of this work is an ageing program to support age-based population models, which are required for an in-depth understanding of population dynamics (natural mortality, individual growth, and recruitment). This program also undertakes special research projects to improve understanding of the dynamics and ecology of these species. An example is an ongoing cod condition monitoring program which has been collecting data on the seasonal cycle in cod condition for over 20 years.

In the spring of 2006, a new poxvirus, salmon gill poxvirus (SGPV), was identified by electron microscopy in the gills of salmon suffering from proliferative gill disease (PGD) in freshwater in northern Norway. Later the same year, this virus was also found in salmon gills at two marine sites in western Norway. All farms suffered high losses associated with the presence of this virus. Clinical disease symptoms are lethargy, respiratory distress, and mortality. In moribund salmon, blocking of gas exchange would likely be caused by the adherence of respiratory lamellae and epithelial proliferation obstructing respiratory surfaces (Nylund 2008). A recent survey of SGPV in wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway revealed a high prevalence of the virus, with high virus loads reported in clinically diseased fish (Garseth et al 2018; Gjessing et al 2017)<br />\nIn 2015, high-throughput sequencing allowed identification of a SGPV-like virus isolated from a wild Atlantic salmon caught in a river in New Brunswick for wild stock enhancement purposes. The sequence mapped with the Norwegian SGPV, with similarities of 80-90% depending on the region of the genome considered. The significance of this detection is still unclear, although there were anecdotal reports that salmon gill diseases of unknown etiology were previously detected on the east coast of Canada (D. Groman, pers. comm.). ACRDP 16-1-G02 was initiated in collaboration with the industry to determine the extent of the virus distribution on the east coast, and its potential to compromise the health of salmons. <br />\nDuring this first project, a preliminary survey was done using a real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. SGPV was detected in wild salmon, in hatcheries as well as in sea farms. With a few exceptions, prevalence was moderate to low. In all cases, viral loads measured by qPCR were all very low (Cts > 30). For sites that were sampled multiple times (sea farms), infection appeared to be transient.  Sequencing analysis revealed 4 genotype variants grouped within a North American (N-A) clade and 1 variant grouping with the Norwegian clade (97.8% similarity for the segment sequenced, herein called NO-like).<br />\nData gathered over the past 2 years are a significant step forward to better understand the <span class=\"caps\">SGPV</span> situation in eastern N-A, but more work is needed to understand its true prevalence in hatcheries and the actual threat <span class=\"caps\">SGPV</span> may represent for Atlantic salmon, especially the variant genetically close to the European variant that has been linked to mortalities in Norway. More work is also needed to determine if the source of <span class=\"caps\">SGPV</span> in hatcheries can be determined.</p>\n\n\t<p>Note: Parts of this project will be conducted in parallel with another <span class=\"caps\">ACRDP</span> submitted concomitantly to study another virus, Piscine reovirus.

Thus, bottom temperature increases have also been detected in some areas. Scallop harvesters are concerned about the impacts of rising water temperatures on their fishing grounds. There are also important temperature fluctuations that are direct artifacts from the fishery practices. For instance, small scallops can be fished from low bottom temperature beds, brought up on deck for sorting in 20\u00b0C air temperature, then put back into the water. Experimental trials will be conducted to assess the physiological reactions of scallops to different temperature regimes. Specific stressors will be assessed to provide concrete information on the physiological state of each animal.

However, stock responses to management measures are complex and can sometimes be hard to predict (Walters 2007, Pine <span class=\"caps\">III</span> et al., 2009; Tunney et al., 2017). Even measures that appear straightforward such as the moratoria applied to Atlantic cod have not had the desired outcome (Neuenhoff et al., 2018). One hypothesis for this inconsistency in some management measures is that traditional fisheries management decisions are species-specific and do not consider ecosystem responses (Pine <span class=\"caps\">III</span> et al., 2009). But to our knowledge there has been no formal evaluation of the level of agreement between the expected and the observed responses of marine stocks to different management measures (but see Menychuk et al. 2013). Such an evaluation would foster collaboration between science and management, where understanding the outcomes of management measures is a critical piece of science that can inform decision-makers on achieving their conservation and sustainability goals. This is particularly true in Gulf and Newfoundland Regions where there are the highest number of stocks in the critical zone of the Precautionary Approach (Oceana 2017) and a requirement to develop rebuilding plans (Bill C-68).

This primary objective will be achieved by completing two sub-objectives: (1) compiling a database on stock status, the management measures that have been applied and their expected outcomes, and the observed response of the stocks, and (2) analyzing the database to determine management measure predictability, by comparing the expected and observed outcomes of fisheries management measures that have been used.</p>", "deliverables": "\t<p>Our deliverables include two main products, namely (1) a database (early-2020) and (2) a synthesis of the effectiveness of management measures applied in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (March 2021).

Fisheries and Aquaculture Management Branch is a collaborator on this project and they have expressed interest in the products of this research particularly to inform rebuilding plans. Species at Risk Branch would also use the database for examining recovery plans and strategies. We argue that this research is also helpful to science to evaluate how advice corresponds to observed responses of the stock. These products will also be used in discussion for the development of a regional ecosystem approach to fisheries management. It is recognized that regional fishery managers have little control over some of the environmental drivers that can affect fish stocks (e.g., climate change) (Carpenter et al. 2017). In the event that environmental change does have negative impacts on a stock, knowledge of management measures that predictably increase the stock across environmental contexts will be in demand.

Differential patterns of gene transcription related to osmoregulatory readiness, infectious agent and disease expression, and growth and immune function will be compared between hatchery and wild smolts.

Activities include a smolt wheel program, a mark-recapture program (seining and angling), snorkel counts, and a freshwater monitoring program (electrofishing).</p>\n\n\t<p>Mark-recapture:<br />\nThe main objective of the mark-recapture program in Margaree River is to recalculate the catchability coefficient in the angling fishery to determine if the current values differ from that estimated during 1987 to 1996.  Stock assessments for rivers in Gulf Nova Scotia (<span class=\"caps\">SFA</span> 18) have been made based on a model developed for the Margaree River. Estuary trapnets were set-up in Margaree River from 1987 to 1996 to provide detailed data on Atlantic salmon returns. For 1987 to 2018, angling catch and effort data from logbooks and provincial license stubs were used to derive the returns. The catchability coefficient per rod-day was estimated from angling catch and effort for the years 1988 to 1996 when a mark and recapture program was used to estimate returns, independently from angling catch. Since 1996, the evaluation of Atlantic salmon stock status in Margaree River is based on applying the catchability coefficient per rod-day for logbook anglers and anglers returning license stubs based on the declared catch and effort.</p>\n\n\t<p>Insufficient numbers of adult salmon were caught on a yearly basis to generate a fisheries-independent estimate. <span class=\"caps\">DFO</span> Science is proposing extra seining events in 2019, in collaboration with First Nations (<span class=\"caps\">UINR</span>, <span class=\"caps\">MCG</span>), the province of Nova Scotia (Margaree Hatchery) and the Margaree Salmon Association (<span class=\"caps\">MSA</span>). The recapture part of the program will remain a volunteer-based spring kelt angling fishery by <span class=\"caps\">MSA</span> members. </p>\n\n\t<p>Snorkel counts:<br />\nSnorkel counts were conducted in the Margaree in 1990-1992 and 1994-1995. Given the difficulty in tagging enough Atlantic salmon in the past six years to generate a fisheries-independent estimate, it is suggested to conduct snorkel counts as a secondary approach to estimate salmon populations in the river. The count would be conducted on the Northeast Margaree, and include the main branch of the river, from Forks Pool to Lower Barracks Pool. After tagging events for the mark-recapture experiment, snorkel counts are proposed to estimate early/late run of salmon (mid-August and beginning October).</p>\n\n\t<p>The snorkel counts will be useful in describing the geographical distribution of the salmon. Given that the seining events will use different color tags, it will be possible to observe the early/late run use of habitat by salmon. It would also be interesting to compare snorkel counts to estimates from the current model, and also to a hopefully successful independent mark-recapture estimate through seining events.</p>\n\n\t<p>Smolt monitoring:<br />\nThe Margaree River smolt wheel program will assess Atlantic salmon smolt production and gather biological information on migrating salmon in this Gulf index river (e.g. run timing, sex ratio, size and age).</p>\n\n\t<p>From 2001-2009, the Margaree River had an Atlantic salmon smolt monitoring program to estimate smolt production and obtain biological information on migrating salmon in this Gulf index river (e.g. run timing, sex ratio, size and age) (Breau et al. 2010, Cl\u00e9ment et al. 2007). After the closure of commercial fisheries for Atlantic salmon in 1984, juvenile densities doubled in the Margaree River, but did not result in greater adult returns compared to those of the mid-1980s. The monitoring program in the Margaree provided the information required to address competing hypotheses of constraints to adult Atlantic salmon abundance, due to low freshwater production or low marine survival. High abundance of smolts migrating from the river permitted to validate the hypothesis that there was low marine survival of the smolts from the Margaree River (Breau et al. 2010).</p>\n\n\t<p>Since Breau\u2019s report in 2010, freshwater production of juvenile salmon in the Margaree has gone down considerably for both fry and parr. From 1991 to 2008, the average densities (fish per 100 m\u00b2 of habitat) for fry and parr are 123.9 and 71.8 respectively; from 2009 to 2018, the average densities for fry and parr are 50.7 and 29.9 respectively. Returns of adult salmon to the Margaree have also been lower since 2012, with a more pronounced decline of small salmon (<span class=\"caps\">DFO</span> 2018). What has been the effect of a decrease in juvenile production on smolt production in this river?</p>\n\n\t<p>The smolt program on the Margaree would also contribute to the following studies:</p>\n\n\t<p>Dr. Cindy Breau (Research scientist, <span class=\"caps\">DFO</span>):<br />\nThere is evidence of acidification and aluminum mobilization in at least 97 salmon rivers across Atlantic Canada (Dennis and Clair, 2012). Of these, only rivers in eastern Nova Scotia with chronic levels of acid and aluminum, where freshwater productivity is low, have been studied. It remains unclear whether smolts in the Gulf region are experiencing episodic increases in acidity and aluminum prior to entering the marine environment. These episodic events have been shown to cause smolt mortality upon entry to the marine environment. Gill samples from smolts leaving the Margaree, Miramichi and Restigouche rivers will be collected with <span class=\"caps\">RST</span>s. Gill aluminum levels will be compared to known levels causing mortality at sea.</p>\n\n\t<p>Dr. Glenn Crossin (Associate professor, department of biology at Dalhousie University, <span class=\"caps\">NSERC</span> grant):<br />\nThis study will evaluate the effects of hatchery rearing on wild Atlantic salmon populations. Crossin will conduct experiments comparing the physiological condition of hatchery-reared versus wild-reared salmon smolts in rivers in New Brunswick (Miramichi River, and Saint John River) and Nova Scotia (Margaree River), and examine differences in their migration behaviour and survival. Differential patterns of gene transcription related to osmoregulatory readiness, infectious agent and disease expression, and growth and immune function will be compared between hatchery and wild smolts. Physiological differences will then be examined as potential correlates for variation in river migration timing and survival, and in marine entry timing and survival. Partners have acoustic telemetry infrastructure in the Saint John and Miramichi rivers and estuaries. Additional receivers will be deployed in the Margaree River, and will take advantage of marine area receiver lines in place in various locations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Cabot Strait, and Atlantic Ocean. This study can provide important information for the development of a <span class=\"caps\">DFO</span> policy on salmonid enhancement programs in Canada.</p>\n\n\t<p>Freshwater monitoring program:<br />\nThe main objective of the electrofishing survey is to track the abundance of juvenile Atlantic salmon at different life stages. Other freshwater species are also identified and measured during these surveys. The Margaree River (SFA18B) electrofishing surveys have been conducted almost annually since 1957. Currently, 13 sites are sampled on the Margaree River (4 closed sites and 9 open sites). </p>\n\n\t<p>An electrofishing crew for this program generally consists of three members: a leader with the backpack electrofishing unit, a member catching shocked fish with a lip seine, and a member catching and carrying the shocked fish. A fourth person is useful while doing the closed sites. With normal water conditions, this is a three week program that usually starts the last week of August and ends mid-September.</p>\n\n\t<p>Water temperature monitoring:</p>\n\n\t<p>Water temperature data for the Margaree is available since 1993. During warm water events on the Margaree in 2018, water temperature data in the Margaree was invaluable in making decisions for closing parts of the river to salmon angling. Closures will rely on the weather station data on the main stem of the Margaree, but predictions can be made on temperatures in other parts of the river by analyzing data from the temperature monitoring program.</p>\n\n\t<p>Currently, water temperature is monitored year-round at 8 sites throughout the Margaree watershed (7 on the Northeast branch and 1 on the Southwest branch). The water temperature is monitored with stationary data loggers (<span class=\"caps\">VEMCO</span>) placed and secured by using a steel pipe. Monitoring sites are visited at least once annually to download the data from the logger, and for maintenance or exchange. This is usually done whenever water is low enough, and/or opportunistically while doing other work in the river.

This project will develop a regional high-resolution application of the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). Though the focus of this model will be coastal, the domain will extend across the Scotian Shelf. In the eastern Scotian Shelf water circulation is heavily influenced by water inflows through the Gully submarine canyon. To date empirical data detailing circulation through the canyon is limited to four mooring deployments in 2006-07 (currently under review -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dmapps/en/projects/592/view/\">http://dmapps/en/projects/592/view/</a>). The AZMP program currently has annual ADCP deployments of on the Halifax and Louisbourg lines, west and east of the Gully, respectively. While these current and historical deployments provide useful information for assimilation into the broader FVCOM model, the lack of data contemporaneous contemporaneously collected with the Louisbourg and Halifax lines inhibits a fulsome assessment of the complex circulation patterns associated with this submarine canyon and the Eastern Scotian Shelf.&nbsp;</p><p>A redeployment of ADCPs in the Canyon would help fill this gap and provide comprehensive dataset for the Eastern Scotian Shelf on which to gauge and improve model performance.

This AOI spans a complex coastline and island archipelago, covering over 2000 square km. Information on oceanographic characteristics of the area are limited to sporadic (&gt;10) deployments of ADCPs, CTDs, and temperature-salinity loggers (microcats). Information on the chemical oceanography in the coastal environment, and the Eastern Shore Islands in particular, is very limited. Productivity in the coastal environment is tightly linked to the chemical oceanographic processes (i.e., spatial variability in pH, Carbon, Nitrogen, etc), which are directly influenced by both terrestrial and marine inputs. A baseline assessment of chemical oceanographic properties of the Eastern Shore Islands will provide important perspective on productivity and diversity in the coastal environment. In particular, data detailing the terrestrial-marine interface will be essential for ongoing monitoring of this site and the coastal environment in general.&nbsp; </p><p>Recent efforts to aid the recovery of the Southern Upland Salmon have focused on pH remediation of rivers through lime dosing. The West River which outflows into Sheet Harbour and the AOI, has undergone lime dosing since 2010. These remediation efforts create a natural gradient and an opportunity to evaluate terrestrial influence on estuarine/marine water chemistry. Information gained from this project will facilitate both an improved understanding of the terrestrial-marine interface and a better understanding of the ecology of the Eastern Shore Islands.&nbsp;</p><p>An incomplete assessment of chemical oceanographic processes could limit the ability of monitoring programs to evaluate ecological change in the face of a changing marine climate in this dynamic nearshore environment. This baseline will provide a needed benchmark for ongoing monitoring of this unique and important area. This work could also provide a strong basis (baseline and collection protocol development) for future coastal chemical oceanographic surveys that are lacking at the moment.</p><p>We propose to undertake two synoptic surveys of the AOI (see supporting materials) to evaluate the chemical oceanography of the area associated with the spring and fall blooms. In 2019 the Marine Research Conservation Group aquired a CTD microrosette sampler and sampling containers required for water chemistry sampling in the nearshore environment. Using this equipment we propose to evaluate both the chemical oceanography and biodiversity using eDNA (see project&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dmapps/en/projects/642/\">http://dmapps/en/projects/642/</a>). This effort could highlight the ability to collect both environmental and biological parameters from a single water sample and would highlight&nbsp;the utility of integrated monitoring using water samples. In addition, the application of eDNA to detect the presence or absence of Atlantic salmon (conservation priority for the AOI) could reveal new information about marine habitat use for this species, which is relatively un-characterized (but see -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dmapps/en/projects/276/\">http://dmapps/en/projects/276/</a>).</p>", "priorities": "<p>The primary objective of this project is to develop a baseline assessment of the water chemistry in the Eastern Shore Islands AOI.

In general, MPAs do not exist in isolation, and are connected through space and time via the dispersal of larvae, movement of adults, and the exchange of materials among habitat patches, populations, communities or ecosystems. MPAs have the potential to form interconnected networks, provided that the configuration of protected areas re-establishes or maintains connectivity of species, habitats, ecological processes, and/or ecosystem services. Correspondingly, connectivity has been identified as an essential component of MPA network (MPAN) design in Canada  and abroad, and is a core component of Canada\u2019s global commitment to \u201censure ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas\u201d, pursuant to the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010) MPAN definition. For marine organisms with pelagic larvae, an accurate representation of near- and far-field oceanography is essential to understand this connectivity. However, this information is often difficult and expensive to obtain, especially in the nearshore environment, where the spatial scales of biological/physical processes are usually small and driven by complex coastlines and localized topography. A lack of well-resolved, appropriately scaled, and modelled circulation limits the understanding of connectivity and ultimately the capacity to develop MPANs of interconnected MPAs, particularly in coastal systems.&nbsp;</p><p>To address this limitation, our<b>&nbsp;</b>project <b>will develop a high-resolution circulation model in the Scotian Shelf Bioregion</b> that resolves complex nearshore properties along the entire coastline and apply this model to <b>simulate dispersal and connectivity across the planning seascape</b>. Dispersal estimates and new insights into coastal oceanographic processes brought forward by this circulation model will inform site selection, site design (e.g., zoning), MPAN configuration, and ultimately monitoring plans with considerations related to biological connectivity. Furthermore, a high resolution coastal circulation model could also be used to evaluate the transport of physical and chemical elements (e.g., pollutants, etc.) and thus inform MPA risk assessments, Marine Spatial Planning, and oil spill response. Lastly, this model will help identify linkages between circulation and key biological processes/conservation priorities for MPAs and coastal EBSA that often remain undeveloped.</p><p>This approach will produce a physical oceanographic baseline required to characterize larval dispersal and potential connectivity among coastal MPAs and between the coastal and offshore network planning areas/bioregion components.</p>", "priorities": "<p>The primary priorities of this project are to:</p><ol><li>Develop a high-resolution circulation model in the Scotian Shelf Bioregion.&nbsp;</li><li>Deploy oceanographic equipment to collect oceanographic data in a complex nearshore environment (Eastern Shore Islands Archipelago).&nbsp;</li><li>Validate and tune the model using collected and other available empirical data (including temperature, salinity, circulation).</li><li>Characterize species into functional dispersal groups (based on timing of spawning, duration, etc).&nbsp;</li><li>Simulate dispersal and characterize connectivity within the proposed MPA network across the coastal and offshore Scotian Shelf planning (sub)domains.</li></ol><p>This project addressed three priorities identified in the 2018 SPERA call that remain highly relevant to existing deparmental mandates (i.e., protection of biogenic habitat, delineations of EBSA delineations, MSP, and AIS).&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>SPERA Priority 7b</strong> \u2013 \u201c<em>incorporating connectivity into MPA Network\r\n(MPAN) planning for species and physical/chemical processes</em>\u201d, by producing\r\nthe physical oceanographic baseline required to characterize larval dispersal\r\nand potential connectivity among coastal MPAs and between the coastal and offshore network planning\r\nareas/bioregion components&nbsp;</li><li><b>SPERA\r\nPriority 3b</b> \u2013 \"<i>refining existing EBSAs as deemed necessary by Regional Oceans and Science colleagues, including updating geospatial information</i>\" by providing an oceanographic model that resolves complex coastal features.

Lawton&#8217;s current system is only deployable to 90 m depth using a copper based video cable system. While the system does have advanced imaging technology and provides similar operational capability to Campod for coastal surveys (capability to track position of the camera system underwater using a <span class=\"caps\">USBL</span> system; integration of <span class=\"caps\">ELOG</span> for coastal mission data management) the present system has some significant limitations. These include no option for power delivery to the underwater package to power high output video lights, lack of laser scaling, depth deployment to 90 m only based on  copper cable video transmission, and limitation for integration of new cameras into the existing system due to underwater bulkhead restrictions.</p>\n\n\t<p>The mid-water system development is centred on the move to an optical fibre-based slip ring winch system that will allow major improvements in deployment scenarios. The new approx. 200 m deployment capability means all current coastal <span class=\"caps\">AOI</span>s and <span class=\"caps\">MPA</span>s are within scope for seabed surveys. The optical cable provides for the use of system components that will be interchangeable with Campod and Videograb. Overall development of these regional-scale benthic research tools is subject to a multi-year planning approach including major science clients and <span class=\"caps\">OETS</span>.

Depending on time scales for capital and O&M acquisitions, along with <span class=\"caps\">OETS</span> workplanning, it is recognized that field trials may not be until late in the field season. For this reason the Lawton&#8217;s 90m deployable system will be maintained in operational readiness for potential use in coastal projects in mid-summer 2020.</p>\n\n\t<p>Projections for O&M requirements for further modification of the mid-water system enabling full system capability similar to Campod (eg remote operation of still camera, Campod attitude package, environmental sensors, etc) in FY&#8217;s 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2023-24 are in the range of $10K annually. This is likely a high estimate, given that a number of existing components from Lawton&#8217;s current system will eventually be transferred across to the new system.</p>", "deliverables": "\t<p>1. Primary application of the new mid-water system will be for seabed surveys to assess benthic species and species assemblage distribution within regionally significant coastal Areas of Interest (eg Eastern Shore Islands), existing <span class=\"caps\">MPA</span>s (eg St Anns Bank), and coastal <span class=\"caps\">ESBA</span>s (eg <span class=\"caps\">SWNB</span>, Brier Island). <br />\n2. The system will also become a significant regional asset for coastal fisheries assessment work, <span class=\"caps\">OPP</span> response planning, etc.<br />\n3. Completion of system development this FY leading to initial field trials in FY 2020-21.<br />\n4. First regional project application will be either a coastal survey within the Eastern Shore Islands <span class=\"caps\">AOI</span> in 2020 (in association with R. Stanley and A. Cooper) or a survey of the Brier Island <span class=\"caps\">EBSA</span> (in association with A. Cooper and C. Goodwin, <span class=\"caps\">HMSC</span>). Either project would use the new mid-water system (if available) or proceed in the initial year of an anticipated two year research project using Lawton&#8217;s current system. Project funds that would be required to support the proposed first field investigations will require discussion through this FY with submission of a field project proposal for FY 2020-21 funding. <br />\n5. Capability for <span class=\"caps\">NCP</span>/MCT project leaders at <span class=\"caps\">SABS</span> and <span class=\"caps\">BIO</span> to have access to a coastal seabed survey system that is easily deployable. The new system, including frame, winch, and surface video recording/survey management deck unit, has been designed to be transportable by truck and to be usable off coastal <span class=\"caps\">CHS</span> vessels (eg Viola Davidson) as well as charted vessels.<br />\n6. Deployment flexibility and expanded depth range (eg 10 m to 200 m+) means that the mid-water system can become a primary bridging system between very lightweight systems deployed off small coastal Science vessels (eg Packcat/Seawolf; only usable to approx. 30 m) and larger offshore systems, such as Campod that require the advanced scheduling of <span class=\"caps\">CCG</span> offshore research vessels. Given the overall design this will be a rapid deployment/multiple use survey tool within any given field season, compared to larger systems that require 1 &#8211; 2 yr advance planning and typically involve only 1 at sea deployment.</p>", "data_collection": "Use of this system will allow for the collection of high-resolution forward- and downward-facing benthic video and digital still images for use in benthic habitat mapping, analysis of coastal EBSAs conservation priority (including location of sponge aggregations, and evaluation of other SBA species distributions) within the overall scope of MPA-related research and monitoring. The image data will be geospatially referenced and acquired with appropriate metadata (e.g. through ELOG) for subsequent archival and reuse purposes.\r\n\r\nSpecific project applications and focal species/analytical approaches will be dependent on the specific projects undertaken by regional science projects.", "data_sharing": "As with image data from the current Lawton shallow-water system the geospatial video and digital still imagery to be acquired with the new system will be share-worthy. Existing imagery assets and inventory work includes development of a Adobe Lightroom catalog for digital still images. Discussions (following some work last fiscal on metadata requirements) are currently underway within CESD with division data manager Peter Krakus on how to make the existing underwater survey data (in terms of locations of historical regional deployments) discoverable through web mapping services.\r\n\r\nBased on continued use of Adobe Lightroom it will be possible to provide customized lightroom catalogs to clients from new surveys (eg for regional Oceans sector).\r\n\r\nOne major consideration for data sharing is the overall volume of the full resolution imagery collected by these types of seabed survey systems. Current coastal imagery holdings are approx. 10TB. Individual video image files can be greater than 4GB (upwards to 20GB), and individual digital still files can be up to 40MB. The full resolution imagery is the critical requirement for the original project lead. To date, concurrent low resolution files have not been collected. There would be a significant additional workload to create new lower resolution imagery assets from historical holdings for online distribution. Given the fact that Lawton does not have any current indeterminate staff, any discussion on making existing imagery assets fully shareable will require specific discussion and funding support.\r\n\r\nContext to the above note:  Lawton has recently copied approx. 30TB of historical offshore video imagery for use in a new collaborative project under the Canadian Healthy Oceans Network that required the imagery to be available for analysis at Memorial University. This involved the set up and use of an unattended copying station that operated 24h a day over significan periods over the past two months. \r\n\r\nFor the new mid-water system application, with some advance planning and discussion, it should be possible to setup the image recording and copying processes for new surveys to also collect (or automate procedures for copying) lower resolution imagery for sharing.", "data_storage": "For the conduct of an initial two year coastal field survey activity using the new mid-water system there is sufficient desktop attached RAID storage available in Lawton's geospatial imaging lab at Saint Andrews. During FY 2019-20 a major consolidation of prior historical survey imagery will be completed. At that point it should be possible to identify a pathway forward for long-term archival of the historical imagery. Completing that assessment and with some transfer of image assets it should free up sufficient local RAID storage for continued survey work.\r\n\r\nAt this time local data storage systems at SABS consist of two duplicated RAID systems of 36TB capacity and one RAID with 50TB capacity. The 36TB systems contain a duplicate set of DFO-specific seabed survey imagery, with one RAID unit typically located at a remote location unless systems are being compared and new data cross-copied. The 50TB unit is being used to archive a complete set of offshore seabed survey imagery from prior multi-collaborator projects where the SABS copy represents either the sole or 1 of only 2 DFO data sets.

Due to the unique setup of these machines the only option has been to install new DFO images on the primary drive leading to the loss of all prior installed software. \r\n\r\nThis situation has had one benefit in being able to migrate these 2012-13 workstations to SSD-based primary drives, RAID 0 SSDs etc to enable improved handling of image files and analysis/editing software. However the requirement to now reinstall and test software (given admin privilege restrictions) means a likely loss of 1 month work activity.\r\n\r\nFor future development and stability of regional imagery-based science applications there is a need for a review of options to insulate science projects from this type of disruption (for example by moving to non-networked system configurations when new hardware systems are implemented", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "No requirements this FY.

MPAs have the potential to form interconnected\r\nnetworks, provided that the configuration of protected areas re-establishes or\r\nmaintains connectivity of species, habitats, ecological processes, and/or\r\necosystem services.

However, this information is often difficult and expensive to obtain, especially in the nearshore environment, where the spatial scales of biological/physical processes are usually small and driven by complex coastlines and localized topography.

The National Framework for Canada's Network of MPAs outlines these design objectives as\r\n\u201c<em>facilitating the protection of\r\necological processes essential for ecosystem functioning</em>\u201d. Ecological processes in this sense\r\nreflect the summation and interconnectivity of species and their function\r\nwithin the ecosystem. An ecological classification system that partitions the\r\nseascape into homogenous spatial units, based on environmental and biological\r\nvariables, can be used as a basis to evaluate representativity targets and\r\nselect model species. Often classifications are built on the abiotic conditions\r\nof the planning area, with the assumption that these conditions are reliable\r\nsurrogates of biological pattern. Whereas abiotic surrogates can provide\r\na reasonable first-order approximation of biological pattern, their ability to\r\nreflect higher-order species assemblages and ecosystem function, and thus\r\nprovide information necessary to meet design objectives, is limited compared to\r\nbiologically derived classifications.&nbsp;</p><p>This\r\nproject will develop a biophysical database, which integrates species-specific\r\nobservational information, functional traits, and environmental correlates of\r\nspecies presence. From this database we will delineate taxonomic and functional\r\nassemblages (groupings). Environmental assignment models will be used to project\r\ngroupings spatially as contiguous ecological classifications (see concept figure) providing\r\nimprovements to existing coarse-scale biological data layers used in MPA\r\nnetwork planning. Using climatological forecasts, we will\r\ncompare current and future spatial classifications to characterize the risk of\r\nclimate associated change. From these classifications, we will identify\r\nemblematic species for more detailed connectivity analyses and future monitoring. The proposed approach will mirror similar efforts on the Pacific coast that have been used in network planning for the Northern Shelf Bioregion (Rubidge et al. 2016).&nbsp;</p><div>MPA network design is challenged by the very\r\nspecies diversity it aims to protect. Indeed, the magnitude of biological\r\ncomplexity characterizing marine systems renders incorporating biological\r\nattributes of all species intractable. The need to imbibe representativity into\r\ndesign necessitates an in depth evaluation of the spatial distribution of multiple\r\nspecies across habitats and ecosystems. By categorizing this biological\r\ndiversity hierarchically, and delineating it spatially, we will provide clients\r\na novel, ecosystem-based tool (see concept Figure panel E) to help achieve and measure\r\nrepresentativity targets in MPA design. Furthermore, our approach will provide\r\nan improved functional classification by cataloging species trait information\r\ninto a diversity based groupings, describing the unique behaviours and-or functions\r\nspecies play in the ecosystem. The identification of important geographical areas\r\nfor functional groups and species assemblages may be more relevant to the\r\ndesign of MPAs or the delineation of EBSAs than individual species, since these\r\ngroupings are more directly associated with important ecosystem processes.</div><div><br /></div><div>Our approach will provide a framework to select species representative\r\nof taxonomic or functional groupings for focused MPA design, research, and\r\nmonitoring. Specifically, this approach will help ensure representativity of\r\nexisting Connectivity Network Modelling (CNM) approaches (e.g., Dibacco and Bradbury 2015), providing information\r\nneeded to identify and characterize the interconnectedness among disjunct areas\r\ncrucial for maximizing dispersal and gene flow among populations. Furthermore, potential\r\ncommunity level changes can be predicted by applying the environmental\r\nclassification model (see concept Figure panel F) to climate forecasts. This approach will help\r\ncharacterize the seascape in terms of susceptibility to change associated with\r\nchanging climactic conditions, and thus will provide an important decision\r\nmaking tool, helping to incorporate resiliency into conservation design.&nbsp;</div><div>Biological classifications based on taxonomic\r\nand functional groupings can match decision making process by providing course\r\nfilter layers (spatial maps; Fig 1E-F) and conservation targets for existing\r\nMARXAN. Preliminary classifications have been informally requested by Oceans Maritimes region and will be available by FY2020 to refine and gauge the efficacy of design in proposed network plans. Connectivity network modelling (CNM) is ongoing&nbsp;and can easily incorporate key model species\r\nidentified by this analysis.&nbsp;Output from the CNM&nbsp;will be used to create a novel decision making tool\r\nhighlighting the ecological (multi-species) connective value of the seascape (Wilcox et al. in prep).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>References</b></div><div><ol><li>DiBacco, C., Bradbury, I.R., and Beiko, R. 2015-16.

The distribution of snow crab across the Canadian range is inextricably linked to temperature, with fluctuating abundance and distribution across their range associated with climate and climate change.

Though this system has proven effective for other groups (e.g., Shark Tagging), proved more difficult than anticipated in the Eastern Shore Islands. In the fall of 2019 we required vessel time on the CCGS Sigma-T and through charter to collect the receivers. There remain to VR-2W receivers that could not be located by either vessel. Because of significant fishing effort (spring - early summer) that overlaps with the period when juvenile salmon are likely present in the AOI, there is strong potential for gear interactions displacing mooring lines, which adds complexity to retrieval. This complexity is in addition to the diverse bottom type (e.g., rock, sand, kelp, high and low bathymetric relief). \r\n\r\nReplacing the VR-2W receivers with ARs is advantageous for several reasons.:\r\n     1.

Each station is sampled with a CTD rosette equipped with a standard suite of sensors, with water being collected at nominal depths for an array of chemical analyses.  As well, vertical ring net tows are conducted at the same frequency in an attempt to enumerate and identify meso-zooplankton following AZMP protocols.  Finally, stratified net tows (BIONESS) were regularly conducted at a single station until funds to maintain this piece of equipment were reallocated in 2016.</p><p>The National Conservation Plan (and previously HOTO) has been providing AZMP with annual O&amp;M contributions over the last five years ($5-18K/year) to supplement costs associated with acquiring and processing these samples (e.g., zooplankton sample analysis, standards for chemical analyses, calibrations of CTD sensors, and equipment maintenance).

Seafloor communities and substrate types will be mapped with novel AUV-based image surveys covering ~100 km/day, or towed video surveys using low-cost camera solutions, in addition to eDNA-based analysis conducted from samples collected by multicore and a Marine Autonomous Plankton Sampler (MAPS, TRL4, UKRI-NOC). This novel instrument collects cells from \u22645 litres of seawater on 0.22um filters, then preserves these with RNAlater. The MAPS can collect &gt;300 water column samples per deployment and will be integrated on the 6000 m rated Autosub6000 for iAtlantic to conduct 3D water column and near-bed mapping using genomic inventories of eDNA harvested from the samples.</p><p>Research Objective: Integration of data from the mesopelagic zone into regional production and nutrient models</p><p>The mesopelagic zone (water column between 200 and 1000 m) is a largely unknown zone that includes micro-organisms, copepods, krill and plankton feeding fish that are lower in the food chain, as well as squids and other higher trophic level fish. The Gully MPA and the adjacent slope and open ocean waters are one of the few areas where surveys of this zone have been completed. However those data have not yet been incorporated into regional production models. This zone is also known to play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, where some estimate that the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide would be ~50% higher without its activities.

Chemo-therapeutants and animal husbandry practices have been traditionally used to keep sea lice under control, but the parasite is becoming resistant to many of the chemicals that are being used. Therefore, there are strong incentives to look at other non-chemical approaches to dealing with sea lice. One of the more promising techniques being developed to remove sea lice from farmed salmon and to control the attached stages is the use of warm water showers. Previous ACRDP project results have demonstrated that the use of a warm water shower can effectively remove up to 95% of the mobile stages of sea lice from the fish in a 30-second treatment with very low mortality rates in the fish. However, a recent study has suggested the possibility that resistance of sea lice to the warm water or freshwater treatments may develop over time, in a manner similar to resistance to chemo-therapeutants. If this is the case, then the efficiency of the warm water shower may decrease over time, to a point where it becomes ineffective in the treatment of sea lice, and some other technology will have to take over. </p><p>The overall goal of this project is to test the concept that sea lice may develop resistance over multiple generations to the temperatures currently being used in the warm water shower to such an extent that the declining efficiency of the warm water shower eventually renders it useless.  If this resistance occurs, understanding the rate of this potential change in resistance to warm water by the sea lice will enable better planning for the lifespan of this technology and the timescale for alternatives to be developed.</p>", "priorities": "", "deliverables": "", "data_collection": "", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": 10014, "allotment_code": 69, "feedback": "<p>Project code is 21R62.&nbsp; Not found in drop-down list.</p>", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": true, "meeting_notes": null, "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-04-02T17:21:13.760-03:00", "last_modified_by": 445, "programs": [10], "tags": [29, 50, 17], "existing_project_codes": []}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 310, "fields": {"year": 2020, "section": null, "project_title": "PARR-2016-Q-04 - Impact of finfish farms in eastern Canada on lobster distribution and condition", "activity_type": null, "functional_group": null, "default_funding_source": null, "is_national": false, "status": 2, "is_competitive": true, "is_approved": null, "start_date": null, "end_date": null, "description": "<p>Organic waste from coastal net-pen fish farming may settle to the sea bottom close to farms, becoming a novel and attractive food source for wild stocks.

Little work has addressed how such changes may have bottom-up effects that impact fisheries species. Impacts may not be restricted to aggregating animals around farm sites, but may also include impacts to wild fisheries due to altered productivity, distribution, or catchability of target species. Indeed, some fishers believe that lobsters congregate in aquaculture sites and thus deploy their traps immediately outside of farm sites whereas others avoid farms areas and do not consider these areas as high quality fishing grounds. Lobster is one of the most widely and intensively fished species in eastern Canada and landings are at historically high levels. Concurrently, the number of fish farms and production has also increased. Concerns about the influence of finfish aquaculture sites on lobster distribution and condition may create challenges for managers, especially if the lobster fishery faces challenges, such as shell disease or decreases in landings, in the coming years as scientific information on the subject is largely absent. This project will examine the spatial distribution and movement of lobster within and around finfish aquaculture sites to evaluate their association with fish farms areas.

Fishing effort in the Maritimes Region is currently concentrated in NAFO Division 4X/5Y (Butler and Coffen-Smout, 2017), and this region also features the most diverse commercial species assemblages and fishery types in the region and can therefore be expected to have the greatest discarding issues. At the same time, Fisheries management decisions on an individual fisheries are often constrained by the limited data on bycatch (retained and non-retained species). In light of this, we have chosen the 4X5Y multi-fishery bycatch as a case study. Knowledge of bycatch has been identified as a key gap in recent groundfish updated and by fisheries management. We propose to evaluate the cumulative impacts of bycatch and assess how this knowledge can contribute to EAFM and EBFM. We will also determine the potential benefits of  further investment in bycatch data collection and analysis.</p><p>The first step in this work is to develop a repeatable, consistent method to extract bycatch data from Observer Records and match with commercial catch records from MARFIS.

This project will provide scientific advice to Oceans and Coastal Management for delivering on this requirement.</p><p>Offshore Benthic Habitats</p><p>For offshore benthos, classification of seabed features based on geomorphology, and community characterization using a benthic habitat template based on scope for growth have been used as proxies for benthic habitats (DFO 2012), as there is no comprehensive map of benthic communities in this region. Neither are valid substitutes for benthic habitat maps based on benthic species distributions, as have been produced on Flemish Cap (Murillo et al. 2016) in support of Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) decisions. There, the structure, composition and distribution of epibenthic invertebrate assemblages on the Tail of the Grand Bank of Newfoundland and in the Flemish Cap area were sampled using depth-stratified trawls. Faunal analysis of 152 uniquely identified taxa, from 439 identified, produced hierarchical synoptic tables of species associations with diagnostic indicators based on species fidelity. Twelve spatially coherent epibenthic megafaunal assemblages were identified, each with relatively sharp faunal boundaries and unique species attributes (Murillo et al. 2016). Such maps are needed in the Scotian Shelf Priority Bioregion in order to address the protection of representative habitats.</p><p>Given this lack of information on benthic species and habitats, prioritization in the Maritimes Region, has been on identifying ecologically or biologically significant areas (EBSAs) formed by marine benthic species, a subgroup of the broader list of representative benthic habitats. Information on EBSAs was compiled from the literature under a previous SPERA project (Kenchington 2014). Fourteen biogenic habitats that are considered to be structure-forming and serving to locally increase species richness and/or contribute significantly to ecosystem function, 4 species groups with key bioturbating function and 4 benthic physical features which may be proxies for EBSAs were identified. Under another SPERA project (2015-16), predictive models of the distribution of some of these EBSA forming species were mapped (Beazley et al. 2017a). However, it was clear that there was insufficient information on benthic species in the Maritimes region to properly map even these ecologically significant benthic species and communities. Improvements to the identification of benthic species on the research vessel ecosystem surveys are required in order to accurately map and validate these benthic EBSAs and the broader benthic habitats for assessment of representivity on the Scotian Shelf. More recently through SPERA, significant benthic areas for corals and sponges, have been mapped (Beazley et al. 2016; Kenchington et al. 2016a,b) and reviewed through the CSAS process. This information has been provided to the Oceans and Coastal Management Division to assist in MPA network planning. However, DFO\u2019s Science Guidance on the Development of Networks of Marine Protected Areas (DFO 2010) states that, \u201c\u2026representative MPAs should capture examples of different biogeographic subdivisions that reasonably reflect the full range of ecosystems which are present at the scale of network development, including the biotic and habitat diversity of those ecosystems.\u201d Although identification of coral and sponge-dominated ecosystems has been accomplished, there is a need to validate that work in some areas, and to undertake a systematic survey of the benthos on the Scotian Shelf in order to evaluate the degree to which the MPA network design represents habitat diversity. This project will create a first benthic habitat map for Maritimes Region based on benthic communities, for use in a variety of management applications, including assessment of representivity in MPA network design, identification and refinement of EBSAs and evaluation of the impacts of fishing. </p><p>The Inshore/Offshore Divide</p><p>Within the context of the above work we will also assess boundaries between offshore benthic communities identified in the above process with those used in coastal classifications (DFO 2012) for the purpose of identifying factors that can inform criteria development for ESAs and create biologically relevant separation of inshore and offshore areas. Currently, for the purpose of MPA network planning within the Scotian Shelf Bioregion, the seaward limit of the coastal zone is defined as approximately 100 m in depth or roughly 12 nautical miles (22 km) offshore (DFO 2012). This definition has no basis in ecology or biology but rather represents the inshore limit of the DFO research vessel ecosystem survey and the licence jurisdiction of some fisheries. Within the coastal zone, two separate physiographic classification systems, which are expected to reflect pattern in biological community were defined: </p><p>Coastline: the landward boundary is the inland limit of the marine waters, sediment and saline influences; the seaward boundary is 10 m of depth. </p><p>Coastal Sub-tidal: the inshore boundary is 10 m of depth and the seaward (outer) boundary is approximately 100 m.</p><p>Building on previous SPERA funded research conducted in three Coastline areas with rich sea grass communities (Wong and Dowd 2015), and in similar previously studied areas with seaweed communities (Schmidt and Scheibling 2007), and with consideration of results from The Inshore Ecosystem Research Project (a joint project between the Fishermen and Scientists Research Society (FSRS) and DFO http://www.fsrs.ns.ca/inshore-research.html) we will evaluate existing data and undertake new data collections in pilot areas connecting Coastline areas through the Coastal Subtidal zone to the offshore using benthic imagery and/or grab samples. We will evaluate the depth, sediments, depth of the photic zone and the lower limit of large marine macrophytes and sea grasses for biodiversity, as key characteristics of ESAs that can inform their boundaries and criteria development in other inshore areas. Both taxonomic diversity (i.e., what species are present) and functional diversity (i.e., what species do based on their traits) will be evaluated.  At the same time, the benthic communities identified in the offshore research component will be modelled using habitat suitability models to within 5 km of land to evaluate their excursion into the Coastal Zone as defined above. These areas will then be targeted with new research vessel trawl stations where possible to validate the model predictions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Our overriding objectives are to: </p><p>1) Map epibenthic megafaunal communities on the offshore Scotian Shelf for use in identification of representative benthic habitats and adjustment of MPA boundaries, and harmonize those with coastal classifications eliminating the arbitrary depth/survey boundary currently used; </p><p>2) Identify new metrics for assessing biodiversity between coastal and offshore areas in a pilot study for application to identification of new characteristics of ESAs that can inform their criteria development.</p><p>Species that live on and under the seafloor (benthos) provide important ecosystem functions, including provision of food and nursery areas for some fish species. Despite their importance to healthy marine ecosystems, the benthic communities of the Scotian Shelf Priority Bioregion have never been comprehensively identified and mapped over large spatial scales. Most of our information comes from small-spatial studies, primarily collected to examine the impacts of experimental bottom trawling on the seafloor, or over large scales for specific vulnerable species such as corals and sponges, or commercially important species such as scallops and clams. We propose to undertake a complete identification of the benthic species collected on DFO research vessel surveys. The species caught will be analysed to identify consistent groupings, or communities, and those will be mapped so that Ocean Managers can review their management areas for the protection of representative benthic habitats. At the same time, we will look at how benthic communities change when moving from inshore waters to the offshore. In particular we will be looking at new measures (e.g., functional diversity) that can be used to identify when biodiversity changes along this path, and re-evaluate how the benthic communities change with depth and distance from shore. All of this information will be used to assist Ocean Managers in identifying ecologically and biologically relevant boundaries for closed areas and to ensure that all benthic habitat types are to some degree protected. This is an important aspect of maintaining healthy and productive ecosystems that support sustainable fisheries.<br></p>", "priorities": "<p>2019-2020 Data analyses and publication (Science); Assessment of Representation of benthic habitats (Management)</p><p>\u2022\tIdentification of benthic communities through faunal analyses;</p><p>\u2022\tMapping of benthic communities; validation of results from Observer data and in situ imagery</p><p>\u2022\tAnalysis of biodiversity gradients with respect to depth, depth of photic zone, presence  of macrophytes and other environmental correlates;  </p><p>\u2022\tPublication of technical reports and preparation of draft manuscripts for primary publication if applicable;</p><p>\u2022\tUploading of spatial data to FGS server.</p>", "deliverables": "<p>Technical Report/Primary Publication: Identification of benthic communities on the Scotian Shelf with a description of their faunal composition and ecosystem services services, along with ID guides for use at sea; </p><p>Spatial Mapping Products: GIS map and .shp files of benthic communities suitable for use in MPA network planning for selection of representative benthic areas and comparison with previous proxies for this attribute.

This is especially true of populations in Atlantic Canada, including DFO\u2019s Maritimes Region. Numerous causes for the declines have been put forward, but one of the most pernicious in MAR appears to be very low marine survival. The MAR live gene bank, and other supplementary hatcheries primarily, rely on the release of juveniles shortly after hatch. While this type of supplementation has been effective thus far at preventing local extirpation of salmon populations, it does not preclude exposure to the high at-sea mortality, and observed returns are typically low. Recently, a number of organizations (e.g. Collaboration for Atlantic Salmon Tomorrow [CAST], Parks Canada, other local NGOs) have expressed great interest in using smolt-to-adult supplementation (SAS) in an effort to bolster local salmon populations. Unlike the more typical supplementation programmes, SAS circumvents the high at-sea mortality by capturing smolts during their outmigration, and rearing them in captivity until they are released into rivers and streams to breed as adults. However, while SAS can provide a benefit through an increase in the number of in-river spawners, this benefit may be offset by the reduced spawning competence of captive-reared fish, and the expected reduced fitness of their progeny relative to wild fish. The degree to which this may occur, is not known because most examinations of the impact of supplementation have involved the more typical release of juveniles, not adults.

The resulting maps of cumulative human impact are useful to identify which areas or ecosystem types are relatively pristine vs. heavily impacted, to determine which stressors dominate human impacts, and to examine impacts under different management or future development scenarios.

Incorporating temporal dynamics (i.e. seasonality, inter-annual or inter-decadal scales) into the CHI framework would provide a better understanding of the current reality of human uses and subsequent impacts in the Maritimes region. For example, human activities may or may not align with the presence or vulnerability of species and/or habitats throughout the year. Assessing where, and to what degree, stressors are changing in intensity and impact over time would provide a means to assess management efficacy and adaptively respond to change. Tracking contemporary trajectories of changing impacts over time may also inform our expectations of future states.

In Canada, seagrass (i.e., eelgrass, <i>Zostera marina</i>) is a major blue carbon habitat, capturing carbon through photosynthesis and particle trapping and storing it in the sediments over millenary time scales.  Globally, seagrasses bury carbon at rates of 138 g C m-2 y-1, with total global storage estimates of 48 to 112 Tg C yr-1.  These estimates exceed those for temperate and tropical forests by at least one order of magnitude.  Compared to other coastal habitats, seagrasses are particularly efficient at storing carbon, responsible for 20% of global carbon sequestration in marine sediments despite only occupying 0.1% of the ocean surface.  </p><p>Canada has the longest coastline of any country in the world (202, 080 km), much of which supports extensive eelgrass beds.  Despite this, our operational knowledge of blue carbon potential derived from Canada\u2019s eelgrass beds is limited.  Dr. Wong is currently working with DFO Policy and Economics (DFO-PE) and the University of British Columbia (UBC) to assess carbon sequestration in Canada\u2019s eelgrass beds, with the anticipated final product being national eelgrass maps overlaid with estimated carbon stocks, obtained mainly from the literature.  This product will allow initial marine spatial and conservation planning of human activities to protect and avoid disruption of these stocks.  However, further refinement is necessary to ensure that coastal planning accurately reflects eelgrass value as blue carbon habitats.  First, the static snapshot of carbon storage in the DFO/UBC project should be extended to include carbon fluxes and emissions from microbial activities and habitat disruption.  Second, Atlantic Nova Scotia is the most data-poor region for eelgrass blue carbon, and further field measurements and processing of archived samples are necessary.  Here, we aim to fill these needs to further enhance the eelgrass blue carbon map for Atlantic Nova Scotia.  Carbon fluxes and emissions will be measured in representative eelgrass beds using eddy covariance and/or benthic chambers. Carbon stocks will be measured from new and archived sediment cores by analyzing them for organic carbon using loss on ignition, CHN, and carbon stable isotopes.  Final products will include spatial maps of organic sediment carbon in eelgrass beds for Atlantic Nova Scotia, and estimates of carbon flux and emissions.  We anticipate these products will be used to identify areas for protection and to minimize human disturbance to blue carbon habitats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Objectives:</p><p>Our objective is to develop a refined spatial map of sediment organic carbon storage in eelgrass beds on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia.&nbsp; The map will show geo-referenced locations of sediment samples and their carbon content and sediment particle size.&nbsp; Fluxes and emissions will be assigned based on sediment type.&nbsp; This work builds on the concurrent DFO/UBC project described above, that aims to produce national maps of eelgrass carbon storge but excludes carbon fluxes, emissions, and includes only minimal data from Atlantic Nova Scotia.&nbsp; Our techniques could be easily applied to eelgrass beds in other regions in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "priorities": "<p>The priority for FY 2020-2021 will be to produce the spatial map of sediment organic carbon based on archived samples and new field measurements.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>", "deliverables": "<p>FY 2020-2021:</p><ul><li>Spatial map showing geo-referenced locations of sediment samples, their carbon content and particle size distribution, for eelgrass beds and associated bare sediments on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia.&nbsp; These data will be submitted to FGP, MSDI, and also the Coastal Carbon Atlas (Smithsonian Environmental Research Centre).</li><li>The overall national eelgrass blue carbon map from the DFO/UBC project will be amalgamated with the above product and made available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>FY 2021-2022:</p><ul><li>Report/primary publication outlining sediment core results and carbon flux and emissions estimates for representative eelgrass beds. </li><li>Updated spatial map that includes these estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>", "data_collection": "<p>Sediment organic matter and carbon content, sediment particle size, carbon flux and emissions data</p>", "data_sharing": "<p>The data obtained from the archived sediment samples will be placed on the open data platform and also in the Coastal Carbon Atlas (Smithsonian Environmental Research Centre) at the end of the first FY (2020-2021).</p>", "data_storage": "<p>In accordance with advice from P.

In addition, feeding will be linked to surficial seabed grain size characteristics.</p><p>Background</p><p>Extensive tidal flats in the macro-tidal inner Bay of Fundy (iBoF) are ubiquitous and provide important habitat for an abundance of shorebirds, fishes and intertidal fauna (Buzeta et al., 2013).  Atlantic Sturgeon, Acipenser Oxyrinchus, which are listed as threatened under COSEWIC, use iBoF tidal flats and channels throughout spring and summer months to feed on buried infauna (Beardsall et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2016), primarily in areas composed of mud with a small sand fraction, &lt;10% (Person et al., 2007). Previous studies by Law et al. (2014, 2019) have documented these same compositions of mud and sand in the southern bight of Minas Basin, on the Kingsport tidal-channel-flat complex. In 2016, the placement of one grid-connected tidal turbine occurred in the Minas Passage, where it remained until being removed for maintenance in 2017. In late 2018, a second test deployment occurred, with more turbines scheduled to be placed in the next 1 \u2013 3 years. Future outlook and potential extractable power calculations suggest commercial development could incorporate hundreds of turbines (Karsten,2011; Mulligan et al., 2013).</p><p>Large development projects such as Tidal In-Stream Energy Conversion (TISEC) devices could fundamentally change regional tidal-flat-channel morphodynamics. Seabed change occurs through either the deposition or the erosion of sediment. In areas that experience a decrease in tidal flow, mud can accumulate while in areas that experience accelerated flow, the erosion of mud could occur, both of which may cause an equilibrium shift in the seabed (c.f. van Proosdij et al., 2009).  This project is intended to examine the prevalence of Atlantic Sturgeon in the iBoF, through observation of excavations left in the seabed during feeding and to establish linkages between preferred feeding grounds and sediment characteristics (i.e. grain size).</p><p>When feeding, Atlantic Sturgeon produce distinct feeding excavations in intertidal sediment as they forage through mud and sand with their snouts. Previous work by Pearson et al. (2007) and Dadswell et al. (2016) suggests that this feeding practice can be a primary erosional and depositional agent on the intertidal mudflats in Chignecto Bay during the summer months. Additionally, a clockwise migratory pattern around the Minas Basin through the summer has been proposed (Dadswell et al., 2016). However, the temporal and spatial distribution of sturgeon within the iBoF, as well as specific habitat utilization patterns, are not well understood. Recent estimates suggest that approximately 9,000-10,000 Atlantic Sturgeon enter the Minas Basin annually to feed on a variety of buried infauna, predominately tube-dwelling polychaetes and amphipods (McLean et al., 2013b). The extreme tide range in the iBoF (&gt;15 m) creates a highly dynamic environment, throughout which desirable sturgeon foraging areas are scattered, both spatially and temporally; it has been shown that foraging sturgeon move more frequently into feeding areas during flood tides than during ebb phases, presumably to increase their foraging time (McLean et al., 2013b). In addition, the highly varied iBoF substrate means feeding areas are often discontinuous, with gravel lags and intertidal ledges mixed amongst feeding grounds. It is possible that the nature of sediments in which Atlantic Sturgeon feed is sufficiently unique. If so, the definition of appropriate feeding grounds based on sedimentary properties such as the dominant or median grain size of bottom sediments may provide insight to Atlantic Sturgeon population vulnerability. This includes the likelihood to which they may be impacted by changing coastal environments, e.g. in response to TISEC devices or sea level rise. Stokesbury et al. (2016) classify the potential for interaction between sturgeon and tidal turbines as \u2018concerning\u2019, and as sturgeon are poor swimmers, their ability to avoid turbines in fast moving water is low.</p><p>Project Description</p><p>This research centers on spatial and temporal sampling of the iBoF intertidal mudflats using RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems) in conjunction with traditional grain size sampling of bottom sediments. RPAS, also known as drones, have recently gained popularity in several facets of geoscientific research, including their use to remotely collect imagery of dynamic areas of coastal change (Cunliffe et al., 2019; Turner et al., 2016: Long et al., 2016), including mudflats (O\u2019Laughlin et al, 2019; Jaud et al., 2016). This includes the generation of high-resolution models, created using digital imagery and the long-standing principle of photogrammetry. Within this approach, a further specialized mapping method known as Structure from Motion (SfM) has been developed to produce a three-dimensional digital topography, constructed using overlapping aerial photographs at multiple viewpoints (Micheletti et al., 2015; Fonstad et al., 2015). This method has proven useful and sufficiently accurate in comparison with existing light detection and ranging (LiDAR) methods, especially in small and more concentrated areas of study. SfM only requires a series of overlapping images, with no special requirements of camera positions, orientations and lens parameters, making it possible to use images collected with consumer-grade RPAS to generate high-quality 3D digital topography (O\u2019Donnell and Smith, 2015).</p><p>Recent results from O\u2019Laughlin et al. (2019) using relatively inexpensive commercial grade Phantom 3 Pro drones from DJI have shown that excavation marks, which can be attributed to foraging Atlantic Sturgeon, were identified at 5 of the 7 sites surveyed in 2018 from around Minas Basin. The clockwise feeding migration around the Minas Basin proposed by Dadswell et al. (2016) is generally supported. Potential feeding excavations were detected in late June on the northern shore of Minas Basin (e.g. Five Islands, Economy), and in July on the southern shore (e.g. Bramber). In addition, excavation marks we found in August 2019 at the Kingsport tidal-flat-complex study site of Law et al. (2019) (O\u2019Laughlin et al., 2019). O\u2019Laughlin et al. (2019) have documented extensive feeding data from Mary\u2019s Point, Bay of Fundy, which shown thousands of feeding excavations that would resemble that of the estimated 10,000 Sturgeon to frequent the Minas Basin during the summer months, yet, preliminary data of O\u2019Laughlin et al. (2019) only show several to 10\u2019s of feeding excavations at the sites sampled in their study. Therefore, a comprehensive study that builds on that of O\u2019Laughlin et al. (2019) is needed to delineate the actual foraging grounds of Atlantic Sturgeon, mapping the areas used for feeding and relating that to the grain size characteristics of those areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "priorities": "", "deliverables": "<p>\u2022\tMaps / Data Layers of Atlantic Sturgeon foraging grounds in the iBoF (Minas Basin)</p><p>\u2022\tEstimation of feeding excavations / numbers</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\u2022\tMaps of seabed grain-size of the foraging grounds</span></p><p>\u2022\tTechnical Report summarizing all the findings of the study&nbsp;</p>", "data_collection": "", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": null, "allotment_code": null, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": true, "meeting_notes": "Lower priority for MSP, but potential SARA linkages (Sturgeon).\r\n\r\n3-year project.

Activities include a smolt wheel program, a mark-recapture program (seining and angling), snorkel counts, and a freshwater monitoring program (electrofishing).</p><p><b>Mark-recapture:</b></p><p>The main objective of the mark-recapture program in Margaree River is to recalculate the catchability coefficient in the angling fishery to determine if the current values differ from that estimated during 1987 to 1996. Stock assessments for rivers in Gulf Nova Scotia (SFA 18) have been made based on a model developed for the Margaree River. Estuary trapnets were set-up in Margaree River from 1987 to 1996 to provide detailed data on Atlantic salmon returns. For 1987 to 2018, angling catch and effort data from logbooks and provincial license stubs were used to derive the returns. The catchability coefficient per rod-day was estimated from angling catch and effort for the years 1988 to 1996 when a mark and recapture program was used to estimate returns, independently from angling catch. Since 1996, the evaluation of Atlantic salmon stock status in Margaree River is based on applying the catchability coefficient per rod-day for logbook anglers and anglers returning license stubs based on the declared catch and effort.</p><p>Insufficient numbers of adult salmon were caught on a yearly basis to generate a fisheries-independent estimate. DFO Science is proposing extra seining events in 2020, in collaboration with First Nations (UINR, MCG), the province of Nova Scotia (Margaree Hatchery) and the Margaree Salmon Association (MSA). The recapture part of the program will remain a volunteer-based spring kelt angling fishery by MSA members.</p><p><b>Snorkel counts:</b></p><p>Snorkel counts were conducted in the Margaree in 1990-1992 and 1994-1995. Given the difficulty in tagging enough Atlantic salmon in the past six years to generate a fisheries-independent estimate, it is suggested to conduct snorkel counts as a secondary approach to estimate salmon populations in the river. The count would be conducted on the Northeast Margaree, and include the main branch of the river, from Forks Pool to Lower Barracks Pool. After tagging events for the mark-recapture experiment, snorkel counts are proposed to estimate early/late run of salmon (mid-August and beginning October).</p><p>The snorkel counts will be useful in describing the geographical distribution of the salmon. Given that the seining events will use different color tags, it will be possible to observe the early/late run use of habitat by salmon. It would also be interesting to compare snorkel counts to estimates from the current model, and also to a hopefully successful independent mark-recapture estimate through seining events.</p><p><b>Smolt monitoring:</b></p><p>The Margaree River smolt wheel program will assess Atlantic salmon smolt production and gather biological information on migrating salmon in this Gulf index river (e.g. run timing, sex ratio, size and age).</p><p>From 2001-2009, the Margaree River had an Atlantic salmon smolt monitoring program to estimate smolt production and obtain biological information on migrating salmon in this Gulf index river (e.g. run timing, sex ratio, size and age) (Breau et al. 2010, Cl\u00e9ment et al. 2007). After the closure of commercial fisheries for Atlantic salmon in 1984, juvenile densities doubled in the Margaree River, but did not result in greater adult returns compared to those of the mid-1980s. The monitoring program in the Margaree provided the information required to address competing hypotheses of constraints to adult Atlantic salmon abundance, due to low freshwater production or low marine survival. High abundance of smolts migrating from the river permitted to validate the hypothesis that there was low marine survival of the smolts from the Margaree River (Breau et al. 2010).</p><p>Since Breau\u2019s report in 2010, freshwater production of juvenile salmon in the Margaree has gone down considerably for both fry and parr. From 1991 to 2008, the average densities (fish per 100 m\u00b2 of habitat) for fry and parr are 123.9 and 71.8 respectively; from 2009 to 2018, the average densities for fry and parr are 50.7 and 29.9 respectively. Returns of adult salmon to the Margaree have also been lower since 2012, with a more pronounced decline of small salmon (DFO 2018). What has been the effect of a decrease in juvenile production on smolt production in this river?</p><p>The smolt program on the Margaree would also contribute to the following studies:</p><p>Dr. Cindy Breau (Research scientist, DFO):</p><p>There is evidence of acidification and aluminum mobilization in at least 97 salmon rivers across Atlantic Canada (Dennis and Clair, 2012). Of these, only rivers in eastern Nova Scotia with chronic levels of acid and aluminum, where freshwater productivity is low, have been studied. It remains unclear whether smolts in the Gulf region are experiencing episodic increases in acidity and aluminum prior to entering the marine environment. These episodic events have been shown to cause smolt mortality upon entry to the marine environment. Gill samples from smolts leaving the Margaree, Miramichi and Restigouche rivers will be collected with RSTs. Gill aluminum levels will be compared to known levels causing mortality at sea.</p><p><b>Freshwater monitoring program</b>:</p><p>The main objective of the electrofishing survey is to track the abundance of juvenile Atlantic salmon at different life stages. Other freshwater species are also identified and measured during these surveys. The Margaree River (SFA18B) electrofishing surveys have been conducted almost annually since 1957. Currently, 13 sites are sampled on the Margaree River (4 closed sites and 9 open sites).</p><p>An electrofishing crew for this program generally consists of three members: a leader with the backpack electrofishing unit, a member catching shocked fish with a lip seine, and a member catching and carrying the shocked fish. A fourth person is useful while doing the closed sites. With normal water conditions, this is a three week program that usually starts the last week of August and ends mid-September.</p><p><b>Water temperature monitoring:</b></p><p>Water temperature data for the Margaree is available since 1993. During warm water events on the Margaree in 2018, water temperature data in the Margaree was invaluable in making decisions for closing parts of the river to salmon angling. Closures will rely on the weather station data on the main stem of the Margaree, but predictions can be made on temperatures in other parts of the river by analyzing data from the temperature monitoring program.</p><p>Currently, water temperature is monitored year-round at 8 sites throughout the Margaree watershed (7 on the Northeast branch and 1 on the Southwest branch). The water temperature is monitored with stationary data loggers (VEMCO) placed and secured by using a steel pipe. Monitoring sites are visited at least once annually to download the data from the logger, and for maintenance or exchange. This is usually done whenever water is low enough, and/or opportunistically while doing other work in the river. Two extra VEMCOS are to be installed on the Southwest in 2019 as there is currently only one for the entire branch.</p>", "priorities": "<p><ul><li>Recalculate the catchability coefficient in the angling fishery to determine if the current values differ from that estimated during 1987 to 1996</li><li>Provide a fisheries independent estimate of adult returns to the Margaree River</li><li>KMK and recreational advisory meetings</li><li>Participation in transfer committee (NS)</li><li>Update estimates of smolts migrating out of the Margaree River to compare with past smolt production in this river.

Climate was a product aiming to do climate studies over long periods of time that included an application to allow users to extracts information according to their specified spatial and temporal criteria. Output results can be either statistical summaries of the data or the actual data stored in the database.  The available data products included;  a station index of latitude, longitude and date/time for each profile selected, individual observations making up the profile, time series based on monthly averages, or a seasonal cycle based on averages over all months from the time series statistics.</span><br></p><p>The data was from a variety of sources including hydrographic bottles, Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) casts, profiling floats, spatially and temporally averaged Batfish tows, and expendable, digital or mechanical bathythermographs. Near real-time observations of temperature and salinity from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) were also included. The database consisted of approximately 850,000 profiles and 35 million individual observations from 1910 to January 2010.Vertical resolution varied from 1 m (for CTDs) to ~ 10-100 m for traditional bottle casts. Climate was updated monthly and approximately 20,000 new profiles were added each year.</p><p>There were several errors and issues with the Climate database and the application and it is no longer in use.  Its main flaws included, low quality data that was not refreshed once data was further processed and QC\u2019d (no synchronization), real-time data with wrong position or wrong date, mix of TE68 and TE90 conventions, providing non-DFO data in the database that was not being refreshed and DFO had no authority over.  </p><p>The Climate database and application was a valuable resource both internal and external and should be made a priority to reinstate.  Some of the major advantages to Climate was;   it greatly reduced the volume of data requests received by BIO and MEDS, allowed for easier reporting such as AZMP, could be used as a baseline for data QC and was a valuable tool for modelers.  With the absence of climate data requests have greatly increased and have become a huge time burden to several employees in all Atlantic Canadian regions.  Currently data assembly/querying and climatology must be created individually for each request, report and modeling project.  </p><p>The objective of this project is to review the scripts, database and data sources used by Climate and determine how best to create or update a similar tool to: compile similar temperature and salinity data, grid the data over the same area defined by Climate, update the data monthly and produce similar products including spatial products.  The end goal is to make these products open access however unlike Climate the database will no longer be available to the public since some of the data is from external sources.   However creating an online open access tool is outside the scope of this project, this project will prepare all the back end data compiling, archiving and analysis to be used by a tool.</p><p>Link to historical Climate database : http://www.bio.gc.ca/science/data-donnees/base/data-donnees/climate-climat-en.php&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>", "priorities": "<p>We expect that the tasks identified below will require 6 months to complete; thus, we are asking for funds to support 2 \u2013 3 month terms from 2019/20 to 2020/21:</p><p>1.\tIn consultation with AZMP Research Scientists, the physical scientists that help with the reporting, and MEDS (Marine Environmental Data Section) compile the temperature and salinity data for the Northwest Atlantic and Eastern Arctic (an area defined by 35\u00b0N - 80\u00b0 N and 42\u00b0W - 100\u00b0 W) from both DFO and external sources.

On mainland NS, electrofishing surveys provide the only annually available information on spawning success of Atlantic salmon. Since 1987, surveys have been conducted in a number of rivers of mainland NS (SFA18A). Currently, there are 6 open sites on each of the following rivers on the mainland: River Philip, East River Pictou and West River Antigonish (n=18).</p><p>An electrofishing crew for this program generally consists of three members: a leader with the backpack electrofishing unit, a member catching shocked fish with a lip seine, and a member catching and carrying the shocked fish. With normal water conditions, this is a three week program that usually starts mid-September and ends early October.</p><p><b>Snorkel Counts:</b></p><p>More information on adult salmon returns on East River Pictou is requested by First Nations. Concerns have been expressed by harvesters on that river concerning low salmon abundance. MCG would like to develop the expertise and capacity to lead assessments on that river. The MCG have been conducting incomplete snorkel counts on East River Pictou and River Philip from 2016-2019 and have requested assistance from DFO. To date, DFO was able to assist in 2018 (1 biologist, 1 day) and in 2019 (1 biologist, 1 day). In 2020, the aim is to increase the number of assistance days, as well as participate in possible marking events by seining to calibrate the salmon counts.&nbsp;MCG does river surveys on both rivers prior to snorkel counts to become more familiar with the pools on those rivers and modify survey areas accordingly. MCG typically complete snorkel counts in August, September and October.</p><p><b>Water Temperature Monitoring:</b></p><p>There are 3 VEMCOS in Mainland NS rivers (River Philip, West River Pictou and East River Antigonish).

Small pelagic acoustics from RV survey: Tools for deriving spatially-integrated abundance indices for small pelagic and bentho-pelagic fish from existing large scale survey programs. This project proposes to use routinely collected data obtained from ongoing large-scale surveys at a negligible marginal cost to develop approaches and tools to improve our knowledge of small pelagic (forage) fish.  In particular, the project seeks to develop as a proof of concept the methodology required to produce new fishery-independent abundance indices and maps of spatial distribution for small pelagic and bentho-pelagic fish species and at the same time to maximize the scientific information captured in existing surveys. The main outcomes will be the integration of automated data processing and the development of new statistical analysis methodology for the production of annual and spatial abundance estimates.</p><p>4.An evaluation of fisheries management measures in the Northwest Atlantic: from predicted outcomes to observed stock responses:&nbsp;DFO is mandated with the conservation and sustainable use of Canada\u2019s fisheries resources. To achieve this, DFO chooses among different management measures based on experience or a specific model prediction. However, stock responses to management measures are complex and can sometimes be hard to predict (Walters 2007, Pine III et al., 2009; Tunney et al., 2017). Even measures that appear straightforward such as the moratoria applied to Atlantic cod have not had the desired outcome (Neuenhoff et al., 2018). One hypothesis for this inconsistency in some management measures is that traditional fisheries management decisions are species-specific and do not consider ecosystem responses (Pine III et al., 2009). But to our knowledge there has been no formal evaluation of the level of agreement between the expected and the observed responses of marine stocks to different management measures (but see Menychuk et al. 2013). Such an evaluation would foster collaboration between science and management, where understanding the outcomes of management measures is a critical piece of science that can inform decision-makers on achieving their conservation and sustainability goals. This is particularly true in Gulf and Newfoundland Regions where there are the highest number of stocks in the critical zone of the Precautionary Approach (Oceana 2017) and a requirement to develop rebuilding plans (Bill C-68). This is a novel exercise and is timely considering the undesirable status of several stocks in these two regions.</p>", "priorities": "<p>1- Develop science advice for rebuilding plans</p><p>3-&nbsp;To derive abundance indices and integrated maps of spatial distribution for small pelagic fish species presently lacking gulf-wide indices (capelin, mackerel and herring) and for recovering species of commercial and ecological importance (redfish) using routinely collected acoustic and trawl data from large-scale surveys.&nbsp;To develop and consolidate both manual and automated data processing tools onto a standard platform and develop statistical modelling methods for the joint analysis of the above-mentioned survey data, thereby constituting a large and efficient value added to existing monitoring.</p><p>4- An evaluation of fisheries management measures in the Northwest Atlantic: from predicted outcomes to observed stock responses:&nbsp;The primary objective of this project is to learn from past management measures by systematically summarizing DFO CSAS stock assessment literature and evaluating the management measures applied to marine fin-fish and crustacean stocks in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. This primary objective will be achieved by completing two sub-objectives: (1) compiling a database on stock status, the management measures that have been applied and their expected outcomes, and the observed response of the stocks, and (2) analyzing the database to determine management measure predictability, by comparing the expected and observed outcomes of fisheries management measures that have been used.</p>", "deliverables": "<p>1- Develop science advice for rebuilding plans</p><p>3-&nbsp;Computer scripts will be developed to convert the echo-integrated data to a format that can be read and processed in Echoview, a powerful software used worldwide to process and visualize fisheries acoustics data.&nbsp;Statistical programming for the estimation of species-specific spatial distribution and spatially-integrated abundance indices.&nbsp;Annual species distribution maps and estimated abundance indices as input to the individual assessments for the stocks in question (capelin, herring, NW Atlantic mackerel and Unit 1 redfish, thereby benefitting the Quebec and Gulf regions).&nbsp;</p><p>4- An evaluation of fisheries management measures in the Northwest Atlantic: from predicted outcomes to observed stock responses:&nbsp;Our deliverables include two main products, namely (1) a database (early-2020) and (2) a synthesis of the effectiveness of management measures applied in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (March 2021). Notably, while there has been some research documenting whether management decisions tend to follow science advice, our approach differs in that we will identify whether expectation agrees with the observed response of the stock. Fisheries and Aquaculture Management Branch is a collaborator on this project and they have expressed interest in the products of this research particularly to inform rebuilding plans. Species at Risk Branch would also use the database for examining recovery plans and strategies. We argue that this research is also helpful to science to evaluate how advice corresponds to observed responses of the stock. These products will also be used in discussion for the development of a regional ecosystem approach to fisheries management. It is recognized that regional fishery managers have little control over some of the environmental drivers that can affect fish stocks (e.g., climate change) (Carpenter et al. 2017). In the event that environmental change does have negative impacts on a stock, knowledge of management measures that predictably increase the stock across environmental contexts will be in demand. Deliverables also include peer-reviewed primary publications, including one manuscript on the expected response of marine fish stocks to fisheries management measures (late 2021).</p>", "data_collection": "<p>acoustic data, database of management measures and outcomes</p>", "data_sharing": "<p>none</p>", "data_storage": "<p>unknown</p>", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "<p>Setting up access to data storage</p>", "sectional_dm_needs": "<p><br></p>", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "<p>Echoview, R, SAS, Access</p>", "chemical_needs": "<p>none</p>", "ship_needs": "<p>as indicated by projects we are supporting</p>", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": 11, "allotment_code": 3, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": true, "meeting_notes": null, "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-04-02T17:21:19.489-03:00", "last_modified_by": 278, "programs": [92, 100], "tags": [], "existing_project_codes": [10033]}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 419, "fields": {"year": 2021, "section": 9, "project_title": "Mobile and fixed gear Sentinel surveys in the sGSL", "activity_type": 1, "functional_group": 10, "default_funding_source": 1, "is_national": false, "status": 2, "is_competitive": false, "is_approved": null, "start_date": "2002-06-03T00:00:00-03:00", "end_date": "2021-05-31T00:00:00-03:00", "description": "<p>The goal of the sentinel surveys in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (4T) is to collect information on commercial groundfish fisheries that are closed or limited.

It is important that changes in maturity are accounted for to correctly estimate spawning stock biomass.

I propose a 3-years of additional research funding to support a large-scale long term monitoring program that will allow acoustic target classification and create unbiased abundance indices for forage fishes in Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf. During the first year of the program, broadband acoustic backscatter data will be collected while concurrently sampling with either a bottom or pelagic-trawl to create an acoustic database to classify acoustic targets. In year 2 and 3, systematic acoustic surveys will be conducted concurrently to the summer ecosystem survey to validate acoustic-based indices performed from randomized transects of the ecosystem survey. Following this research program, it is expected that acoustic-sampling during the summer ecosystem survey could be implemented to provide long-term monitoring acoustic-based indices. Validation of this research program would be contingent on the deployment of the EK80 echosounder system that will be available with the newly constructed DFO research vessel. Accurate, large-scale forage fish abundance indices from this monitoring program could provide a means to better understand what ecological (and social-economic) processes drive forage fish dynamics and distributions. The program should begin this fiscal year (2019-2020) to prepare for the upcoming launch of the new research vessel.\r\n\r\nMethodology:  \r\n\r\nCalibration and deployment (Year 1,2&3): Calibration of an EK80 echosounder system equipped with ES38-7, 70-7C, 120-7C, 200-7C transducers) will occur using a small DFO vessel (CCGS Salar) at St. Andrews Biological Station. Following calibrations, EK80 echosounder systems will record wideband multi-frequency acoustic data to determine whether software is operating adequately. With permission, wideband multi-frequency acoustic data of an active herring weir will be recorded and compared to length-sampled data to provide validation known empirical values of herring single-target acoustic backscatter. It should be noted that calibration of the EK80 echosounder system deployed on the new DFO research vessel will also be required prior to the annual ecosystem survey of Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf.\r\n\r\nAcoustic and biological sampling (year 1): Acoustic sampling will be collected aboard the CCGS Viola Davidson, as well as chartered fishing vessels to build a library of acoustic backscatter data using a wideband multi-frequency echosounder system. Biological sampling will occur concurrently using a bottom or pelagic-trawl to sample fish. For as many sets as possible, the net will be towed for a period of 3 to 5 minutes, catch will then be identified to lowest practical taxonomic level, weighed, and length measurements will be taken for at least 200 individuals for each fish species. To determine the accuracy of acoustic target classification, targeted and randomized sampling will be conducted to capture catch composed of a single species (i.e.,<90% of the catch) and data composed of mix of species, respectively.\r\n\r\nAcoustic target identification and validation (Year 1, 2): Echoview software will be used to estimate acoustic backscatter from pelagic and demersal fish species. Acoustic target identification of fish species will occur using the collected wideband multi-frequency acoustic data, by modifying existing methodology of acoustic target identification for North Atlantic marine fishes (Korneliussen 2018). Species biomass and composition will be estimated directly from acoustic data and will be compared to and validated using concurrently sampled biological data.\r\nPreliminary research indicates that we will be able to provide acoustic target identification for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), mackerel (Scomber scumbus), dogfish (Squalus acanthias), redfish (Sebastes spp.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), pollock (Pollochias virens), and silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis).\r\n\r\nAcoustic survey program and comparison to the summer ecosystem survey (Year 2, 3): Chartered vessel(s) will be used to perform a systematic acoustic survey of Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf during July-August for two years. Multiple chartered vessels could be used to perform different legs of the acoustic survey and biological sampling will not be conducted. Chartered vessels must have the ability to deploy an EK80 echosounder system operated by an acoustician. Chartered vessels will require minor modifications to a davit to deploy a pole-mount or be equipped with a wing-stabilizer to deploy a clamped-body or have the ability to deploy a towed-body from a cable wire.  \r\n\r\nThe systematic acoustic survey will be conducted concurrently to the summer ecosystem survey of Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf. The new research vessel scheduled to be deployed in 2019/2020 will be equipped with a EK80 echosounder system operating with multiple frequencies. As in previous ecosystem surveys performed by the CCGS Alfred Needler or CCGS Teleost, acoustic data will be continuously recorded and be used as means to estimate acoustic-based indices of abundance of fishes. However, unlike previous surveys, the use of wideband multi-frequency EK80 echosounder system on the new research vessel would allow for direct identification of fish species using acoustic target classification and will likely be more accurate than the existing acoustic-based indices of abundance (i.e., the approach used to estimate and index for western component pollock abundance; Debertin unpublished). Two years of sampling will be required to avoid potential survey year effects (i.e., unexplained observation error effects) and will be used to determine whether the randomized acoustic transects from the summer ecosystem survey will be sufficient to provide an accurate acoustic-based index for forage fishes. \r\n\r\nWorkplan: \r\n\r\nThis research will require the hiring of a 3-year term BI-02 biologist. The BI-02 biologist will be assigned to work and train with existing Fisheries Acoustic working group staff. The BI-02 biologist will be tasked to calibrate the EK80 echosounder system, assist with the initial deployment and biological sampling aboard the CCGS Viola Davidson, transportation of the EK80 echosounder and assistance with mounting it to the chartered vessel, and coordination with chartered vessel crew acoustic survey transects.

For example, the Herring Science Council and Groundfish Enterprise Allocation Council will both be interested in this larger research program because it could provide more accurate acoustic-based indices for herring, mackerel, pollock, cod, haddock, redfish, and dogfish. This program would also provide acoustic-based indices of zooplankton aggregations and large pelagic fishes. Costs associated with the project include the purchase of a 38 kHz ceramic transducer and fabrication of metal mounting brackets that would allow the deployment of the EK80 echosounder system on chartered vessels. Other costs will be for the calibration of echosounders, employment of a 3-year term BI-02, field and travel expenses for DFO staff, and chartering a industry vessel, totalling ~$202K for year 1 and ~$230K for year 2 and 3.  DFO in-kind staff and equipment to the research project total approximately $340K per year. The equipment used for deployment was procured by DFO, one indeterminate biologists (BI-03) will provide logistical support to the project.\r\n\r\nManagement Implications:\r\n\r\nIn 2018, 4VWX herring was considered to be at the Lower Reference Point, suggesting the stock may be at risk of collapse.

I propose a 3-years of additional research funding to support a large-scale long term monitoring program that will allow acoustic target classification and create unbiased abundance indices for forage fishes in Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf. During the first year of the program, broadband acoustic backscatter data will be collected while concurrently sampling with either a bottom or pelagic-trawl to create an acoustic database to classify acoustic targets. In year 2 and 3, systematic acoustic surveys will be conducted concurrently to the summer ecosystem survey to validate acoustic-based indices performed from randomized transects of the ecosystem survey. Following this research program, it is expected that acoustic-sampling during the summer ecosystem survey could be implemented to provide long-term monitoring acoustic-based indices. Validation of this research program would be contingent on the deployment of the EK80 echosounder system that will be available with the newly constructed DFO research vessel. Accurate, large-scale forage fish abundance indices from this monitoring program could provide a means to better understand what ecological (and social-economic) processes drive forage fish dynamics and distributions. The program should begin this fiscal year (2019-2020) to prepare for the upcoming launch of the new research vessel.\r\n\r\nMethodology:  \r\n\r\nCalibration and deployment (Year 1,2&3): Calibration of an EK80 echosounder system equipped with ES38-7, 70-7C, 120-7C, 200-7C transducers) will occur using a small DFO vessel (CCGS Salar) at St. Andrews Biological Station. Following calibrations, EK80 echosounder systems will record wideband multi-frequency acoustic data to determine whether software is operating adequately. With permission, wideband multi-frequency acoustic data of an active herring weir will be recorded and compared to length-sampled data to provide validation known empirical values of herring single-target acoustic backscatter. It should be noted that calibration of the EK80 echosounder system deployed on the new DFO research vessel will also be required prior to the annual ecosystem survey of Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf.\r\n\r\nAcoustic and biological sampling (year 1): Acoustic sampling will be collected aboard the CCGS Viola Davidson, as well as chartered fishing vessels to build a library of acoustic backscatter data using a wideband multi-frequency echosounder system. Biological sampling will occur concurrently using a bottom or pelagic-trawl to sample fish. For as many sets as possible, the net will be towed for a period of 3 to 5 minutes, catch will then be identified to lowest practical taxonomic level, weighed, and length measurements will be taken for at least 200 individuals for each fish species. To determine the accuracy of acoustic target classification, targeted and randomized sampling will be conducted to capture catch composed of a single species (i.e.,<90% of the catch) and data composed of mix of species, respectively.\r\n\r\nAcoustic target identification and validation (Year 1, 2): Echoview software will be used to estimate acoustic backscatter from pelagic and demersal fish species. Acoustic target identification of fish species will occur using the collected wideband multi-frequency acoustic data, by modifying existing methodology of acoustic target identification for North Atlantic marine fishes (Korneliussen 2018). Species biomass and composition will be estimated directly from acoustic data and will be compared to and validated using concurrently sampled biological data.\r\nPreliminary research indicates that we will be able to provide acoustic target identification for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), mackerel (Scomber scumbus), dogfish (Squalus acanthias), redfish (Sebastes spp.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), pollock (Pollochias virens), and silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis).\r\n\r\nAcoustic survey program and comparison to the summer ecosystem survey (Year 2, 3): Chartered vessel(s) will be used to perform a systematic acoustic survey of Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf during July-August for two years. Multiple chartered vessels could be used to perform different legs of the acoustic survey and biological sampling will not be conducted. Chartered vessels must have the ability to deploy an EK80 echosounder system operated by an acoustician. Chartered vessels will require minor modifications to a davit to deploy a pole-mount or be equipped with a wing-stabilizer to deploy a clamped-body or have the ability to deploy a towed-body from a cable wire.  \r\n\r\nThe systematic acoustic survey will be conducted concurrently to the summer ecosystem survey of Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf.

Most of Canada's MPAs have the goal to protect marine biodiversity rather than any one particular habitat or species, making comprehensive monitoring of biogenic habitat, fish, invertebrates, cetaceans, and marine birds a priority. In order to monitor the specific conservation objectives of MPAs, we currently require ecosystem trawl and other annual survey data, opportunistic whale and marine bird sightings, industry support to observe and monitor large pelagic fishes, and advanced camera/video systems to observe deep sea corals and sponges.

Sequencing eDNA captured from small volumes (~1 L) of water yields millions of DNA sequences that can be compared to a reference library and rapidly determine which species are present in an area, and their relative abundance. eDNA metabarcoding has been shown to be comparable to other traditional sampling techniques, including SCUBA surveys, camera surveys, and trawling.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the relative simplicity of eDNA as a potential monitoring tool, there is still a lack of information on the spatial scale of eDNA sampling required to conduct comprehensive biodiversity surveys within a large MPA, the temporal scale at which the eDNA signal fluctuates in a given area (i.e., daily, monthly, ...?), and how eDNA moves and sinks or is resuspended by ocean currents. While we are unable to address every issue with the so-called \"ecology of eDNA\", we aim to investigate the spatial and temporal scale at which eDNA must be sampled to provide reliable results, as well as the effects of local environmental variables (water temperature, pH, salinity) on the correlation of eDNA results with the seining/trawl catch.&nbsp;</p><p>Our project will develop a standardized protocol and bioinformatics pipeline for eDNA metabarcoding and evaluate its use for measuring presence and relative abundance (specifically for select marine fishes) and general biodiversity in the marine environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Our broad overall <b>project goals</b> are to: </p><p>     (1) develop and implement nationally a standardized eDNA metabarcoding approach for monitoring marine biodiversity in Marine Protected Areas in Canada, including bioinformatics pipeline which can complement existing surveys;</p><p>     (2) field test the approach at various spatial and temporal scales in three oceans to improve our understanding of if, and how, it can meet the needs of MPA managers and other end-users; and</p><p>(3) contribute tissue samples towards an eDNA reference library that is necessary to identify species contained within eDNA samples. We will take tissue samples from each species of fish and invertebrate captured in seine and trawl surveys to sequence their gene regions of interest to be added to a DFO reference library.

Since 2016, Canada has endeavored on an ambitious expansion of MPAs, moving from <1% (55,000 km2) in 2016 to 10% (~570,000 km2) by 2020.\r\nAddressing these commitments, including measuring MPA network effectiveness, will require intensive ocean monitoring at unprecedented scales. Traditional marine survey methods rely on direct sampling and are often spatially restricted, taxon-specific, costly, difficult to calibrate, and in some cases destructive; thus are limited in their ability to capture large spatial and temporal complexity in marine systems. These limitations, and DFO\u2019s mandate to monitor the expanding Canadian MPA network, as well as other biodiversity conservation initiatives, necessitate innovative approaches to measuring marine diversity.\r\nHere, we propose to evaluate an indirect, synoptic, and cost-efficient eDNA metabarcoding approach as a potential tool for marine biodiversity monitoring, with specific applications to the Canadian MPA network and other initiatives (e.g., OPP). We will develop a nationally-standardized eDNA metabarcoding protocol that will be tested in three of Canada\u2019s ocean systems.

Observations of potential foraging habitat will be\r\ncoordinated with NARW tagging characterizing their horizontal and vertical\r\nmovements to understand interactions of NARW and their prey at local scales.\r\nThe field study provides observations required to understand and model the\r\ninteractions of vertical migration behaviour and local flow fields that lead to\r\ncopepod aggregations where NARW prefer to feed. </p><p>\r\n\r\nData analysis \u2013 groundtruthing multifrequency acoustics:\r\nMultifrequency acoustic backscatter observations were collected from across the\r\nsGSL during the August 2019-2020 field mission, and VPR and net observations\r\nwere made along short transects and stations throughout the region. To\r\nground-truth the algorithms used to interpret the multifrequency acoustic\r\nobservations, comparisons will be made between acoustic data and co-located\r\nmeasurements of species composition and size (nets) and vertical distribution\r\n(VPR) of plankton. This component builds on extensive previous work on the\r\ndevelopment of algorithms for processing multifrequency acoustics and on\r\nimplementing image analysis procedures for the VPR data. This analysis supports\r\nimproved assessment of broadscale observations of NARW foraging habitat in the\r\nsGSL.</p><p>\r\n\r\nData analysis \u2013 copepod vertical migration behaviour:\r\nCopepod diel and ontogenetic migration behaviour will be assessed based on VPR\r\nand stratified net observations in fall 2018, summer 2019, and late\r\nspring-early summer 2020. This analysis provides information about copepod\r\nvertical positioning behaviour that is essential to understand NARW prey\r\ndistribution, estimate copepod transport in coupled models, and characterize\r\nbiological-physical interactions leading to copepod aggregation. An undergraduate honours project will also assess the\r\ninfluence of size and other traits copepod vertical position.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Data analysis \u2013 NARW foraging habitat usage: Comparison of\r\nNARW dive characteristics and copepod vertical and horizontal distributions in\r\nthe sGSL in summer 2019. Copepods aggregations were observed near-bottom during\r\nthe day in waters ca. 80-110 m deep, and they moved up into the water column at\r\nnight. Tagging data indicated that NARW dives mainly followed the same pattern,\r\nwith daytime dives targeting near-bottom depths during the day.&nbsp; This analysis will assess the linkage between\r\ncopepod and NARW vertical distributions in NARW foraging areas. </p><p>\r\n\r\nSynthesis \u2013 Review paper on the biological and physical processes\r\nthat contribute to development of aggregations of Calanus copepods at depths\r\naccessible for NARW feeding in the NW Atlantic continental shelf system.</p>", "deliverables": "<p>Peer-reviewed publications</p><p>Comparison\r\nbetween vertical distributions of taxa-specific zooplankton abundance and multifrequency\r\nbackscatter in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (Sorochan, K., Comtois,\r\nS.,&nbsp;

There are two fixed \"single gate\" receiver lines (arrays) maintained by OTN in our region: one between Northern Cape Breton and Southwestern Newfoundland and one extending southward from Halifax towards the continental shelf edge. These OTN receiver arrays greatly increase the detection opportunities beyond those of our St Anns Bank receivers . Opportunistic detections of animals tagged through this project also occur on other worldwide acoustic telemetry projects maintaining receivers as well as mobile Wave Gliders carrying telemetry receivers. These gliders are operated by OTN and add substantial value as they are an active searching method approach as opposed to the passive detections by fixed receivers.</p><p>The tag application component of this project occurs aboard a chartered commercial fishing vessel using baited fish traps. This fishing method is used to help ensure the best possible health of animals to be tagged. Once brought aboard, potential candidate animals are stored in live tanks. Healthy looking animals are chosen for tag implantation surgery. Depending on species behavior, some animals are momentarily anesthetized for the surgery. Post-surgery, tagged animals are placed in a recovery tank and then returned to the ocean as soon as animal health and behavior seems normal. </p><p>The detection of tagged animals within the MPA is accomplished through the maintenance of a \u201cdouble gate\u201d receiver array consisting of two straight lines of 23 receivers. This requires annual retrieval of each receiver for offloading of detection data, replacement of the battery and acoustic release lug and subsequent redeployment. The vessel , crew and labour for this work is provided by a local fishing association at no cost to DFO. The raw detection data is processed by OTN and is provided to DFO. A summary of tag detections is then produced annually. This requires contacting numerous external [to DFO] researchers to determine some detail on species, timing and location of tag application.</p>", "priorities": "<ul><li>Application of tags</li><li>Cataloging all tagged animals detected in the MPA</li></ul>", "deliverables": "<ul><li>Release of tagged animals</li><li>Non-published report summarizing animals detections for distribution to project collaborators</li><li>Retrieval and redeployment of acoustic receiver array (46 individual moored receivers)</li></ul>", "data_collection": "<p>Animal movement data including species, timing and position.&nbsp;</p>", "data_sharing": "<p>N/A</p>", "data_storage": "<p>Acoustic tagging data is warehoused through the Ocean Tracking Network which creates the necessary links to other telemetry projects.&nbsp;</p>", "metadata_url": "https://obis.org/dataset/80997ac3-87cb-411c-ab1f-334adec45050", "regional_dm_needs": "<p>N/A data curation and storage are facilitated through the OTN</p>", "sectional_dm_needs": "<p>N/A</p>", "vehicle_needs": "<p>Full size truck capable of carrying fishing and tagging gear.

The scallop fishery in the Northumberland Strait is mostly conducted in areas where water stratification is not permanent and where the water masses are mixed. Thus, bottom temperature increases have also been detected in some areas. Scallop harvesters are concerned about the impacts of rising water temperatures on their fishing grounds. There are also important temperature fluctuations that are direct artifacts from the fishery practices.

Experimental trials will be conducted to assess the physiological reactions of scallops to different temperature regimes. Specific stressors will be assessed to provide concrete information on the physiological state of each animal.

As land use practices in PEI have evolved, there has been an increase in suspended solids entering waterways, which, in turn, has lead to increased siltation deposits on wild beds. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential negative effects of increased siltation, both on juvenile oyster health and on recruitment to natural and artificial collectors (Craig et al. in prep.; Poirier et al. 2019; Tamburri et al. 2008). In order to mitigate the effects of silt buildup, \u201cdesilting\u201d devices can be raked along the bed in order to re-suspend the silt deposits during a flushing tide. Timing is crucial; desilting must be complete prior to spat settlement in early summer, or in the late fall prior to winter ice cover. Fishers anecdotally report that this action may have the effect of increasing suitable (i.e. clean) surface area for the recruitment of spat, as well as improving shell growth and subsequent shape of juvenile and adult oysters. However, little is known about this method\u2019s practicality, and it\u2019s suitability for inclusion in long-term bed enhancement efforts as the potential impacts that this practice could have on the surrounding estuarine ecosystem remain unclear. </p><p>In order to test this methodology, we propose a two-year project focusing on a 40-acre oyster bed (Mackinnon\u2019s Point oyster bed) in PEI\u2019s West River. Historically, the PEI government desilted Mackinnon\u2019s point bed and it was considered \u201chealthy\u201d while also having concentrated amounts of fishing activity. Desilting activity has since ceased as enhancement efforts have been focused elsewhere on spat collection and seeding of other wild public beds.  For our purposes, the bed will be subdivided in 6 equal sized plots. The desilter device (similar to an agricultural harrow) will be applied to half of the plots randomly. In addition to measuring silt fall on the experimental plots, silt levels would also be recorded in nearby upstream and downstream locations of the oyster beds using a variety of methods: passive silt traps (i.e. mats and cones), and active sediment traps which utilize fiberoptic sensors to track the siltation rate through time (e.g. Bouchard et al., 2014). In order to accurately characterize the effects of desilting on stock status, measurements of oyster recruitment as well as oyster growth and shape pre- and post-desilting will be conducted over two growing seasons.</p>", "priorities": "<p>a)\tImprove understanding of stock status: This information is critical to assessments of overall wild oyster bed health, and of the potential benefits or impacts of enhancement activities. It will enable DFO to address future stock status through the use of modelling and predictive assessments.</p><p>b)\tIncrease understanding of key ecosystem processes: This research will help understand specific impacts of desilting via ecosystem monitoring and water quality assessments. It will also better describe sediment dynamics at local oyster bed sites.</p><p>c)\tImprove understanding of the biology of exploited marine species: Our experimental trials will be aimed at understanding the physiological responses (i.e. morphometric) of oysters to specific levels of siltation that occur on commercially exploited areas of PEI waterways. Results will also provide information for an understudied aspect of oyster recruitment processes to be looked at in the context of the Southern Gulf regional industry.</p><p>d)\tImprove knowledge of the impact of fishing activities or other human activities: This experiment will monitor and report on a potential human activity that could have effects on surrounding resources. As the estuaries where these oyster beds are located are nursery areas (i.e. eelgrass beds) for many commercial species, caution must be taken before any enhancement activity is encouraged.</p>", "deliverables": "<p>1) Obtain assessments of capability of desilter device to remove or dislodge sediment from oyster beds</p><p>2) Obtain responses of oyster spat recruitment to the desilting process</p><p>3) Completion and submission of the interim and final reports for FSCP</p><p>4) Completion of a primary publication highlighting the use and suitability of desilting as a recruitment and stock enhancement mechanism</p>", "data_collection": "<p>counts, measurements, data files (csv)</p>", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "<p>gvt vehicles and section boats will be used</p>", "it_needs": "<p>Regular suites already in place within the section</p>", "chemical_needs": "<p>Samples will only be kept fresh or frozen.

We will exploit recently collected bathymetric data, acquired using lidar in 2011 in Tracadie Bay, to create a spatially explicit model. The model will be built and then validated through the deployment of tidal and current loggers, and using environmental data from a nearby weather station. After the model has been validated, maps for water circulation and residence time will be created. Dissolved oxygen and other nutrient data, collected by DAAF and industry, will be used to identify knowledge gaps and inform a conceptual model for subsequent ecosystem modeling efforts (although not a deliverable for this project). Ultimately, the hydrodynamic model will be used to evaluate potential management action or projected changes to Tracadie Bay in the future using simulations. These scenarios will specifically address the consequences of the northern outlet closing, or being manually expanded, and will ultimately be used for management decisions. </p><p>The second objective is to determine areas within the bay that are at risk of hypoxia. This will be accomplished by monitoring dissolved oxygen directly via data loggers and through spatially intense surveys for water quality, sediments, nutrient sampling conducted by DAAF and benthic flux (i.e. internal nutrient dynamics). Similar to the maps created in the first objective we will create a \u201cheat-map\u201d indicating areas of concern for aquaculture in Tracadie Bay.</p><p>The third and final objective is to determine thresholds of effect of anoxia, hydrogen sulfide and temperature on cultivated oysters using a combination of field and laboratory work.

Currently, the MEQ program assesses trophic status of estuaries using an integrated modeling system, which includes a tidal prism model (TPM) and a land-based nutrient loading model (SINM) (Bugden et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2015). Due to the coarse spatiotemporal resolution of the TPM, the integrated model lacks the capability to simulate the direct/indirect impacts of land-based nutrients on estuarine biological processes such as: primary production, directly via nutrient uptake, and secondary production, indirectly through phytoplankton uptake by bivalves; both of which are key for eutrophication dynamics (Guyondet et al. 2015). Objective: Enhance modeling tools to assess the impacts of land-based nutrient loading, primarily from agriculture, on estuarine ecosystems. Approach: a distributed marine model based on the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM; Chen et al. 2003) and the existing biogeochemical model CE-QUAL-ICM (Cerco et al. 1994) will be coupled and compared with the current TPM-SINM model. This coupled FVCOM-CQI model will simulate the main processes of estuarine nutrient dynamics from land-based inorganic loading to primary and secondary producers. Specific attention will be paid to bivalves as they are the secondary producers that exert the most influence on these dynamics. </p><p>Laboratory experiments will be conducted to address the knowledge gap associated with combined effects from dissolved oxygen and high temperature, expected stressors in eutrophic areas, on bivalve survivorship. FVCOM-CQI will receive daily nutrient loading input from TINM (Objective 2.1) and through high frequency nitrate logger data (SUNA) collected at the head of tide. Furthermore, the MEQ program will provide data for ecosystem variables and parameters through which the FVCOM-CQI will be calibrated and validated. In addition, the estuarine fish community will be assessed annually using traditional beach seining methods (Weldon et al. 2005) and compared to a potentially more accurate genetic method (eDNA). Four estuaries over four years: Dunk (2019\u20132020), Dunk and Wheatley (2020\u20132021), Dunk and Souris (2021\u20132022), Dunk and Darnley (2022\u20132023) will be examined.

Counts and biological information on over 10 species is collected. The trapnets are the basis for the mark-recapture experiment that generates the population estimates for large and small salmon returning to the branches. Similar data collected by Eel Ground and Red Bank First Nations at four different trapnets are also important pieces of the mark and recapture model. Currently, the trapnets are the only means to collect information on the commercially important gaspereau and American shad in the Miramichi river. Catches of striped bass at index trapnets are used as an annual index of abundance. We entertain annual requests by other researchers for data collection or specimens from fish captured in DFO trapnets. The Index Trapnet Program and other Miramichi programs are delivered out of the newly renovated South Esk facility that houses offices for three indeterminate staff. Duties for these staff in the winter months include salmon scale mounting and aging, angler tag return letters, products for ICES, data entry/verification, database management, purchase of equipment and supplies in preparation for next field season, dissection and detail sampling of gaspereau that was not completed in the summer, OHS inspections, and NS license stub entry.

While the main objective of the program has been to track the abundance of juvenile Atlantic salmon at different life stages, the database has also proven useful in tracking trends of <b>other freshwater species</b> and/or life stages (e.g. American eel). In recent years, DFO conducts approximately 60 sites throughout the watershed with an aim to conduct at least four sites on main tributaries. Electrofishing sites are a combination of closed sites (n=5) and open sites (n=55). Generally, an electrofishing crew for this program consists of three members: a leader with the backpack electrofishing unit, a member catching shocked fish with a lip seine, and a member catching and carrying the shocked fish. With normal water conditions, this is a five week program that usually starts the last week of August and ends at the end of September. The Miramichi electrofishing program relies heavily on the Miramichi Salmon Association who has provided two crew members annually for many years. The fish and habitat data collected from the survey are entered into databases and verified by DFO staff in Miramichi. Scales from the survey are also mounted and read by Miramichi staff. Analysis of the data is conducted by Miramichi staff and included in stock status assessments, advice to managers, and shared with user groups in a variety of reports and presentations.</p><p>The water temperature at approximately 16 sites throughout the Miramichi watershed has been monitored year-round since 1997. The water temperature is monitored with stationary data loggers (VEMCO) placed and secured by various means. Monitoring sites are visited at least once annually for logger maintenance or exchange. This is usually done in August when flows are low and access to the loggers is easiest. The crew consists of at least two people; one with snorkel and dry suit, the other supervising from shore. This program doesn\u2019t occur on consecutive days but instead on opportunistic days when conditions, other simultaneous programs, and resources (staff, trucks) permit. The temperature data is downloaded, verified, and archived in databases. There are multiusers and multi requests for this data annually. The water temperature data from this program was used in the development of DFO\u2019s warm water protocol that is used to limit or close areas to recreational angling in the Miramichi watershed.</p>", "priorities": "", "deliverables": "", "data_collection": "", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": 101, "allotment_code": 3, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": true, "meeting_notes": "need to add MCG as external collaborator", "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-04-02T17:21:28.026-03:00", "last_modified_by": 277, "programs": [102], "tags": [19, 7, 15, 18, 36, 17], "existing_project_codes": [1058]}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 553, "fields": {"year": 2020, "section": 22, "project_title": "R Learning and Development", "activity_type": null, "functional_group": null, "default_funding_source": null, "is_national": false, "status": 2, "is_competitive": false, "is_approved": null, "start_date": null, "end_date": "2023-02-26T00:00:00-04:00", "description": "<p>This project organizes and delivers Job Specific Technical Training relevant for staff in OESD, CESD, SPAD and PED at BIO.

No typical clinical signs associated to HSMI (i.e. change in behaviour, mortalities, etc.) were observed in parallel (DiCicco et al 2017). <br /></p><p>\r\nDetermination of the PRV situation on the Eastern coast of N-A is ongoing, as part of collaboration with the industry initiated in 2016 (ACRDP 16-1-G-01). <br />\r\nData gathered over the past 2 years provide a significant advance into the PRV situation in eastern N-A, but some knowledge gaps remain to determine if the actual PRV strains detected pose a threat to Atlantic salmon, wild or farmed, and if preventive management procedures can be developed to reduce the potential risk of HSMI outbreak. This project aims to answer these questions.    There is pressure in BC regarding PRV introduced by farmed fish, and the risk PRV poses to wild salmons, thus science needs to inform decision makers. Further, with projects to import European fish in NL for aquaculture, the proposed project is relevant and will provide science to better understand the effect of fish genetic on the susceptibility to develop HSMI. The goal of this work is to further demonstrate if&nbsp;HSMI can be an issue on the Eastern coast of Canada, to begin to explore the reason for fish resistance, and to reduce chances that HSMI ever becomes an issue by providing possible mitigation solutions to the aquaculture industry.</p><p>Note: Parts of this project will be conducted in parallel with another ACRDP submitted concomitantly to study another virus, Salmon Gill Poxvirus. Both projects will use the same sample collected to respond to their respective objectives, and the imported European Atlantic salmons will be divided and used for both projects.

In the spring of 2006, a new poxvirus, salmon gill poxvirus (SGPV), was identified by electron microscopy in the gills of salmon suffering from proliferative gill disease (PGD) in freshwater in northern Norway. Later the same year, this virus was also found in salmon gills at two marine sites in western Norway. All farms suffered high losses associated with the presence of this virus. Clinical disease symptoms are lethargy, respiratory distress, and mortality. In moribund salmon, blocking of gas exchange would likely be caused by the adherence of respiratory lamellae and epithelial proliferation obstructing respiratory surfaces (Nylund 2008). A recent survey of SGPV in wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway revealed a high prevalence of the virus, with high virus loads reported in clinically diseased fish (Garseth et al 2018; Gjessing et al 2017)<br />\r\nIn 2015, high-throughput sequencing allowed identification of a SGPV-like virus isolated from a wild Atlantic salmon caught in a river in New Brunswick for wild stock enhancement purposes. The sequence mapped with the Norwegian SGPV, with similarities of 80-90% depending on the region of the genome considered. The significance of this detection is still unclear, although there were anecdotal reports that salmon gill diseases of unknown etiology were previously detected on the east coast of Canada (D. Groman, pers. comm.). ACRDP 16-1-G02 was initiated in collaboration with the industry to determine the extent of the virus distribution on the east coast, and its potential to compromise the health of salmons. <br />\r\nDuring this first project, a preliminary survey was done using a real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. SGPV was detected in wild salmon, in hatcheries as well as in sea farms. With a few exceptions, prevalence was moderate to low. In all cases, viral loads measured by qPCR were all very low (Cts &gt; 30). For sites that were sampled multiple times (sea farms), infection appeared to be transient.  Sequencing analysis revealed 4 genotype variants grouped within a North American (N-A) clade and 1 variant grouping with the Norwegian clade (97.8% similarity for the segment sequenced, herein called NO-like).<br />\r\nData gathered over the past 2 years are a significant step forward to better understand the SGPV situation in eastern N-A, but more work is needed to understand its true prevalence in hatcheries and the actual threat SGPV may represent for Atlantic salmon, especially the variant genetically close to the European variant that has been linked to mortalities in Norway. More work is also needed to determine if the source of SGPV in hatcheries can be determined.</p><p>Note: Parts of this project will be conducted in parallel with another ACRDP submitted concomitantly to study another virus, Piscine reovirus.

Answering this question would allow us to determine the actual threat SGPV may represent for farmed and wild salmon. The recent discovery of a SGPV variant more closely related to the strain causing pathology in Norway has raised the level of concern. In Europe, poxvirus has been identified by 40% of survey respondents as the 1st or 2nd most important agent of disease in freshwater in Europe (Rodger H, Gills Heath Workshop 2017, BC, Canada).

A meeting is held near the end of the field season (November - December) to assess the completeness of the data load and to coordinate the load of all remaining data.</p><p class=\"\">Upon return from the mission, the Chief Scientist completes the cruise report.&nbsp; This is a summary of all activities conducted with some preliminary value added products.&nbsp; Like all other mission data, the final report is submitted to ODIS for storage in the designated cruise report folder.&nbsp; This report also contains the preliminary revised CTD oxygen sensor and conductivity sensor calibrations which are then confirmed by another ODIS Technician before being applied to the revised CTD profiles (ODF and QAT files).&nbsp; These re-calibrated profiles are consolidated&nbsp; into an equipment specific archive (ARC) by year.&nbsp; The bottle data in BioChem are also adjusted to reflect the newly calibrated data.</p><p class=\"\">Mooring and flow through logs are also stored in the mission folder (SRC) but the ADCP data from the NSCM are held in the moored ADCP data folder in the \"ARC\".</p><p class=\"\">Starting in 2020, all mission data collected by the program will undergo a more stringent QC to flag data prior to entry into databases.&nbsp; AZMP has been modifying existing script developed by IML for this purpose.&nbsp; In fact, these scripts have been used extensively to QC data from 1999-2013 so it could be reloaded into BioChem.&nbsp; A 2013 audit of BioChem by an ODIS Technician found numerous errors that needed by be addressed and AZMP has mobilized significant resources to address those concerns since that time.&nbsp; We are nearing the final stages of this flagging process and we hope to have the older AZMP data (1999-2013) partially reloaded into BioChem before the end of the 2019/2020 fiscal year.</p><p class=\"\">All program data and meta-data are supposed to be made available through the AZMP website (http://isdm-gdsi.gc.ca/isdm-gdsi/azmp-pmza/index-eng.html).&nbsp;

We've worked closely with ODIS over the past 6 years to develop ship-board metadata management systems and database staging tools that have improved our ability to track data while at sea, as well as monitor and manage the incoming data associated with that mission throughout the year.&nbsp; This has improved the overall quality of AZMP data and has eased the pressure on those developing value added products for reporting to filter/correct data derived from either file or database archives.</p><p>ODIS has worked with AZMP to conduct a full audit of our file and database management systems.&nbsp; As stated above, this has led to the recognition that a complete reload of QC'd AZMP data to BioChem was necessary.&nbsp; We've been working closely with ODIS, OESD Data Manager and casual employees to address these concerns.&nbsp; Over the past year (due mostly to ODIS human resource considerations), AZMP has been drawing more of it's data management field and post-mission support from the OESD Data Manager.&nbsp; It's unclear at this point if the responsibilities will continue to lie within the Division, or if AZMP will again draw on ODIS field support when HR issues have been resolved.</p><p>The OESD Data Manager has been working more closely with AZMP over the last year (particularly field support).

They have also taken on some software and application solutions development roles left vacant by HR issues in ODIS.

Each station is sampled with a CTD rosette equipped with a standard suite of sensors, with water being collected at nominal depths for an array of chemical analyses.  As well, vertical ring net tows are conducted at the same frequency in an attempt to enumerate and identify meso-zooplankton following AZMP protocols.  Finally, stratified net tows (BIONESS) were regularly conducted at a single station until funds to maintain this piece of equipment were reallocated in 2016.</p><p>The National Conservation Plan (and previously HOTO) has been providing AZMP with annual O&amp;M contributions over the last five years ($5-18K/year) to supplement costs associated with acquiring and processing these samples (e.g., zooplankton sample analysis, standards for chemical analyses, calibrations of CTD sensors, and equipment maintenance).

Surface temperatures of the Northwest Atlantic have been rising for\r\ndecades, while the bottom temperatures have been increasing on the Scotian Shelf\r\nsince the mid-2000s. The biological impact of these temperature changes can be\r\nprofound, altering the availability and distribution of suitable habitat, which\r\nin turn can have a significant influence on the success of a species. Landings\r\nand estimated biomass of north Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus)\r\nhave been steadily increasing over the past decade. In this study, I examine\r\nwhether warming bottom temperatures are related to the expansion of Atlantic\r\nhalibut. Depth, bottom temperature and growing degree days (GDD) were used to\r\ncharacterize preferred habitat from 1990 to 2018 using a regional oceanographic\r\nmodel. I found an increase in preferred habitat and GDD during this time,\r\ncoinciding with the period of increase in Atlantic halibut landings. I further\r\nexplored the relationship between halibut abundance and environment using a\r\nrecruitment index time series (juvenile abundance) derived from annual research\r\nvessel trawl surveys, finding that increased juvenile abundance coincided with\r\nan expansion of available habitat.

Traditional marine survey methods rely on direct sampling and are often spatially restricted, taxon-specific, costly, difficult to calibrate, and in some cases destructive; thus are limited in their ability to capture large spatial and temporal complexity in marine systems. These limitations, and DFO\u2019s mandate to monitor the expanding Canadian MPA network, as well as other biodiversity conservation initiatives, necessitate innovative approaches to measuring marine diversity.\r\nHere, we propose to evaluate an indirect, synoptic, and cost-efficient eDNA metabarcoding approach as a potential tool for marine biodiversity monitoring, with specific applications to the Canadian MPA network and other initiatives (e.g., OPP). We will develop a nationally-standardized eDNA metabarcoding protocol that will be tested in three of Canada\u2019s ocean systems. We will examine spatial and temporal dynamics of diversity revealed through eDNA in water samples and will directly compare results to those obtained by traditional survey methods.", "responsibility_center": 10026, "allotment_code": 28, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": false, "meeting_notes": null, "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2019-12-18T11:19:01.106-04:00", "last_modified_by": 577, "programs": [6], "tags": [38, 2, 5, 55, 12, 36], "existing_project_codes": []}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 617, "fields": {"year": 2021, "section": 22, "project_title": "Towards a national map of Canada's eelgrass beds", "activity_type": 4, "functional_group": 28, "default_funding_source": 18, "is_national": true, "status": 1, "is_competitive": null, "is_approved": null, "start_date": "2020-04-01T00:00:00-03:00", "end_date": "2021-03-31T00:00:00-03:00", "description": "<div><b>Priority:&nbsp; Marine Spatial Planning (MSP):&nbsp; Contribute data and spatial layers to marine atlas; Identify priorities and gaps in layers</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>Project Description:</b></div><p>Eelgrass (<em>Zostera marina</em>) forms extensive underwater meadows along much of\r\nCanada\u2019s coastlines.&nbsp; These nearshore\r\nhabitats provide valuable ecosystem services such as carbon storage, fisheries\r\nmaintenance, biodiversity support, shoreline protection, and water\r\nfiltration.&nbsp; Given their location in\r\nshallow waters between land and the open ocean, eelgrass beds are highly\r\nsusceptible to human activities.&nbsp; To ensure\r\nthe continued provision of eelgrass ecosystem services, marine spatial planning\r\nis required to reduce interactions between human activities and eelgrass beds.&nbsp; Such planning is highly dependent on maps of\r\neelgrass distribution, yet comprehensive national maps of eelgrass coverage do\r\nnot exist.&nbsp; While DFO Science Maritimes\r\nis currently developing techniques using species distribution models and\r\nsatellite imagery to predict eelgrass coverage, other DFO regions, NGOs, and agencies\r\nare also conducting their own mapping initiatives.&nbsp; Interest was expressed at a recent eelgrass\r\nworking group meeting to combine efforts to work towards a national eelgrass\r\nmap for Canada.&nbsp; Here, we propose to\r\ninitiate this effort by scoping available eelgrass maps and data, compiling\r\ndata into a common database, and mapping known eelgrass coverage.&nbsp; This would create the building blocks for a\r\nnational eelgrass map that could be continually updated, and be used to\r\nvalidate model predictions and identify data-poor regions.&nbsp;</p><div><b>Project Objective:</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Our objective is to initiate development\r\nof a national map of eelgrass distribution, by:&nbsp;\r\n(i) conducting a scoping exercise to identify available datasets and maps,\r\n(ii) compiling available data and maps of eelgrass extent, (iii) constructing\r\nmaps from extent data if necessary, and (iv) creating a first stage national map of\r\neelgrass extent on Canada\u2019s shorelines.&nbsp; This\r\nproject would bring together mapping activities being conducted both within and\r\noutside of DFO.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n<p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Collaboration with other projects:&nbsp;</b></p></div><div>We envision this work to be a\r\ncollaboration with other ongoing projects within DFO.&nbsp; M.

In 2018 an overview was conducted (Jeffery et al. 2019) detailing the spatial and temporal ecological attributes of the AOI.

The abundance of plant and algal biogenic habitats was assumed to host a diversity of juvenile fish species. However, at the time of the review no systematic information on nearshore fish communities had been developed.&nbsp;</p><p>The <b>primary objective this project </b>is to begin development of a long-term biodiversity monitoring program in the Eastern Shore Islands. We propose implementing this program with the use of direct (beach seines) and indirect (environmental DNA - eDNA) sampling approaches. Preliminary sampling will be conducted at sites (3-4) distributed throughout the AOI and will be repeated through the year to identify any seasonal variation in fish/invertebrate assemblages. Using this first year of data we can begin the development of a pre-implementation time-series while at the same time testing the application of eDNA as a monitoring tool.&nbsp;</p><p>Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a useful tool to examine marine biodiversity in a non-invasive way, on a small spatial scale. eDNA can be easily collected and filtered and is becoming increasingly cost efficient to sequence, and may be a useful marine protected area monitoring tool. While eDNA generally yields comparable results to traditional sampling techniques in terms of biodiversity captured, little is known on how eDNA signals fluctuate on a temporal (hourly, daily, monthly, etc) basis. An secondary&nbsp;<b>objective </b>of this study is to examine <b>temporal</b>&nbsp;(seasonal) <b>variation </b>in fish and invertebrate community composition within the Eastern Shore Islands Area of Interest (AOI) using coastal beach seining and eDNA.

This approach has the advantage of being very easy to apply\r\nbut the results are impacted by the depth and constituents of the water column\r\n(e.g., phytoplankton, sediment).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Method 2</b>: In the second approach, the contribution by the water\r\ncolumn is removed to retrieve the reflectance of the seafloor&nbsp;(i.e., benthic reflectance, Figure 1 - method 2), which is done by\r\nsolving the mathematical formulation of the radiative signal. The benthic\r\nreflectance is further interpreted in term of bottom-type using existing libraries&nbsp;(e.g., vegetation, sand or\r\nmud). While this method provides a better characterization of the seafloor and\r\ninformation on bathymetry, which is of interest to CHS, its application is more\r\nchallenging and require information on the optical properties of the marine\r\nconstituents and the bottom reflectance.&nbsp;</p><p>SPECIFIC PRIORITIES</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">(i) Refine existing satellite-based methods\r\nfor habitat-type classification from high-resolution imagery, </p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">(ii) Apply these techniques to map nearshore habitat\r\nand bottom-type (i.e., eelgrass, kelp, soft and hard bottom) using high-resolution\r\nsatellite data for selected sites,</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">(iii) Develop species distribution models for eelgrass\r\nand kelp using environmental data from satellite and in situ sampling,</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">(iv) Compare habitat maps obtained from satellite\r\nimagery, LiDAR data (CHS), and species distribution models to identify\r\nadvantages and disadvantages of each method,</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">(v) Use derived habitat maps to\r\ncharacterize the seasonal and inter-annual phenology of eelgrass and kelp.</p>", "priorities": "<p>Identification of important areas and species (b) Refining existing\r\nEBSAs</p><p>\r\n\r\nDFO-Oceans is committed to integrated,\r\necosystem-based coastal management. A key component of this approach is the\r\nidentification and management of Ecologically and Biologically Significant\r\nAreas (EBSAs)&nbsp;in nearshore areas, which are\r\nnotoriously data-poor.&nbsp; Coastal\r\necosystems are often characterized by biogenic habitats such as seagrasses and\r\nmacroalgae that provide valuable ecosystem functions and services, and these are\r\nemphasized for protection and inclusion within EBSAs.&nbsp; Despite their conservation value, and more\r\ngenerally their importance as indicators of ecosystem health, comprehensive\r\ninformation on the spatial distribution of nearshore biogenic habitats and\r\ntheir ecological condition is typically lacking.&nbsp; Furthermore, the ability to predict biogenic\r\nhabitat distribution from physical characteristics is rudimentary but would be\r\nhighly valuable. Large-scale mapping of biogenic habitats and development of\r\npredictive distribution models would help further refine existing coastal EBSAs\r\n(54 in Scotian Shelf region), describe new candidate areas, and allow long-term\r\nmonitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, appropriate\r\ntechniques that can be easily applied across large spatial scales and are\r\nrelatively low-cost allowing repeated application require further development. Here,\r\nwe address these needs by using high-resolution satellite imagery of ocean colour\r\nto map the distribution of nearshore biogenic habitats, specifically eelgrass (Zostera marina) and kelp (e.g., Laminaria digitalis). Frequent\r\nrevisiting of sites over several years by high-resolution ocean colour\r\nsatellites will allow the characterization of the seasonal cycles of eelgrass\r\nand kelp as done in other coastal environment&nbsp;.\r\nWe will also develop species distribution models using environmental data important\r\nfor eelgrass and kelp health than can be derived from satellite (e.g., turbidity,\r\ntemperature) and in-situ measurements (e.g., current and sediment sulfite).\r\nThis will help predict macroalgae habitat in highly turbid or deep waters (&gt;\r\n10m) where satellite imagery does not perform well.&nbsp; DFO Oceans will use this work to further\r\nrefine existing EBSAs and to identify new potential areas for conservation\r\nwithout the need for intensive field sampling programs.&nbsp; Our work will be conducted in areas\r\nprioritized for conservation by oceans, but will have general applications nationally\r\nfor nearshore conservation planning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "deliverables": "<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b>Year-1:\r\n</b></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">1.1 Archive high-resolution satellite data\r\nfrom Sentinel-2 A&amp;B and Landsat 8 sensors between 2014 and 2019.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">1.2 Worldview images from Oceans processed<i>,</i></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b>Year-2:</b></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">2.1 Habitat classification in\r\nGIS-compatible format for selected sites of the Atlantic coast of NS derived\r\nfrom Satellite Ocean Colour, LiDAR and species distribution models.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">2.2 Dataset of oceanographic and\r\nbottom-habitat measurements from fieldwork</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b>Year-3:\r\n</b></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">3.1 Technical\r\nreport assessing the performance and applicability of satellite, LiDAR and\r\ndistribution models to retrieve bottom-habitat</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">3.2 Document on\r\nthe phenology of macroalgae in the Eastern Shore Island EBSAs and other sites\r\nselected by Oceans</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">3.3 Maps of\r\nbottom-habitat in the nearshore of NS in GIS compatible format</p>", "data_collection": "<p>Satellite data from Sentinel-2 A&amp;B SMI and Landsat 8 OLI</p>", "data_sharing": "<p>It is not possible to place satellite data on open data platform, however, the data are available upon requests</p>", "data_storage": "<p>Data are archived on an external hard drive.</p>", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "<p>No IT requirements, we have computers in the RSG to perform the task</p>", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": null, "allotment_code": null, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": false, "meeting_notes": null, "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-01-11T11:17:36.117-04:00", "last_modified_by": 869, "programs": [35], "tags": [52, 12], "existing_project_codes": []}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 632, "fields": {"year": 2021, "section": 39, "project_title": "Remote Sensing Group", "activity_type": 1, "functional_group": 60, "default_funding_source": 38, "is_national": false, "status": 2, "is_competitive": false, "is_approved": null, "start_date": "2019-04-01T00:00:00-03:00", "end_date": "2020-03-31T00:00:00-03:00", "description": "<p>The remote sensing group (RSG) downloads, processes and archives satellite ocean colour and sea-surface temperature data in support of ecosystem monitoring and management, as well as to study the impact of climate change on Canada's three oceans.

While much of the data that led to the area's designation as an AOI was collected in the nearshore coastal areas (i.e., seagrass and kelp distributions, coastal bird nesting sites, herring spawning areas), there is less information available on the fish and invertebrate community structure in offshore areas of the AOI. Current offshore sampling effort is primarily focused in the Summer multi-species RV survey which covers the Scotian Shelf but does not sample within the depth range covered by the AOI (~ &lt;100m depth). The 4VsW Sentinel Survey historically has provided information on fish diversity in the inshore but due to financial limitations has scaled back in the number of stations surveyed (currently 18 stations within the 4VsW sampling area down from 202 in 2004). This reduction in extent inhibits a characterization of biodiversity, limited to a handful of stations in any given year sampling only ground fish species.</p><p>Both groundfish and Atlantic Salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) are conservation priorities for the Eastern Shore AOI, primarily because of the diverse biogenic habitats that act as juvenile groundfish nurseries, and the fact that numerous rivers within or adjacent to the AOI are Atlantic Salmon spawning grounds. However, there is little information on the offshore usage of the AOI by groundfish outside of their nursery habitats or by Atlantic Salmon as they enter the marine environment. A broader understanding of the offshore marine environment used by these fishes within the AOI would provide baseline information on their distribution for monitoring purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>Information on the distribution of species within a protected area is essential for the management and monitoring of a site. Decisions made on zoning, risk assessment, activity approvals and management effectiveness all require information on the distribution and status of species. Moreover, the design and implementation of a monitoring program within an MPA requires baseline information, which for the Eastern Shore is particularly lacking spatially, temporally and taxonomically. The current AOI study area is 2089 square km extending along 100 m of coastline. When compared to other coastal focused MPAs - Eastport, Gilbert Bay, Basin Head and Musquash (2.1, 60.8, 9.44, 7.7 square km, respectively) - developing an ecological baseline by which to monitor biodiversity focused objectives is a monumental task. The application of new technologies that can be deployed synoptically (i.e., no large or specialized gear required) and that can reflect the diversity of species within a given location, are critically needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Environmental DNA (eDNA) offers a promising approach for biodiversity monitoring that has been gaining increased attention in the marine realm. Through sampling relatively small volumes of water (~1L), eDNA can capture of millions of fragments of eDNA on specialized filters that can then be sequenced to identify the species composition of an area. eDNA metabarcoding is based on the foundations of DNA barcoding, where species are identified solely by their unique DNA sequences. eDNA metabarcoding relies on a comprehensive reference library of gene sequences from known species to rapidly identify which species are captured in every water sample. This method is relatively simple, efficient (with the ability to characterize both fish and invertebrate diversity), and non-invasive, meaning there is no disruption of sensitive benthic habitats or need to dissect tissue samples from captured fish and invertebrates. eDNA has been shown to be comparable to other biodiversity censusing techniques and has the potential to rapidly conduct biodiversity surveys over a relatively large area, such as the Eastern Shore Islands AOI. Currently field trials are underway to compare eDNA to direct sampling approaches employed by DFO (trawling and seining) (Abbot et al. 2019).&nbsp;</p><p>We will collect eDNA at specific offshore sampling sites at a number of depths to census the benthic and pelagic fish communities and provide baseline information for the AOI. Specifically, we aim to examine the distribution of Atlantic Salmon, Atlantic Cod, Pollock, Halibut, other groundfish, and other pelagic fishes at offshore sites using eDNA sampled over numerous transects. We will compare eDNA species lists to data collected by the 4VsW Sentinel Survey as a method of groundtruthing our results. We may collect fin clips from specimens of interest captured by the 4VsW Sentinel sruvey to sequence genes of interest to be entered in a DFO-wide reference library for eDNA. This information will provide valuable baseline information for the AOI for use by DFO Science and Oceans Management and will integrate with coastal work conducted in 2019 (Abbott et al. 2019) and proposed for 2020 (<a href=\"http://dmapps/en/projects/620/\">http://dmapps/en/projects/620/</a>).&nbsp;Such a baseline will be invaluable should the AOI become an MPA in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We propose that sampling for this work be combined with proposed water chemical analysis for the AOI (<a href=\"http://dmapps/en/projects/256/\">http://dmapps/en/projects/256/</a>).

However, previous tagging studies and industry survey data suggest the stock may have more structure. Results from conventional tagging studies show that some halibut exhibit resident behaviour or show seasonal fidelity to an area, moving between shallow foraging grounds in the summer and deeper water for spawning in the winter. In contrast, other individual halibut exhibit more extensive movements across the management area. The existence of a sub-structure or of subpopulations within a stock may increase the risk of local extinction. This may occur through heavy fishing pressure on locally abundant sub-populations that have weak connectivity with neighbouring sub-populations and/or experience slower growth and recruitment rates due to different thermal regimes. Although it is possible for re-colonization of a depleted subpopulation to occur through a density-dependence response, strong philopatric behaviour, low demographic rates or excessive fishing pressure may weaken the connectivity. The risk of overexploitation is heightened with species that have slow life-history traits, such as expressed in Atlantic halibut. Thus, it is important for robust stock management to understand the structure of the fishery stock.</p><p>Recent research has revealed two persistent core areas of high juvenile abundance, one in southwest Nova Scotia and the other close to the Gully. This finding suggests juvenile halibut exhibit strong preferences to particular habitats, making such communities vulnerable to density-dependent habitat selection. That is, if these areas become overpopulated, resources could become depleted and juveniles forced to move to lower quality habitat that could impact their growth trajectory and lower their reproductive potential.</p><p>The geographical extent of the Scotian Shelf-southern Grand Banks management unit and the differing thermal regimes within, provide an opportunity to understand how juvenile and adult halibut move in response to different sea temperatures. It is known that populations will likely change their distribution with a warming climate but this change may not necessarily be toward the poles. Given the forecast of climate warming over the next few decades, the greater our knowledge on how fish as individuals and populations respond to changes in their thermal environment the more likely we are to effect appropriate stock management policy and keep ahead of environmental change. To identify the presence of subpopulations within a stock one must be able to document the movements of individuals independent of where the species is fished. For example, although there is an opportunity to report the location of caught tagged halibut during the halibut longline fishery, sampling is restricted both temporally and geographically. Thus, an understanding of fish movement based on conventional tag returns is unlikely to be representative of the species distribution. Satellite tracking using Pop-up Satellite Archival Transmission (PAT) tags can overcome these spatial-temporal constraints although are costly, thus samples sizes are far smaller than those of conventional tag studies. Results from a recent satellite tracking study on adult halibut agreed with the patterns of movement observed from conventional tag studies. However, to measure the degree of individual variability in movement patterns and develop confidence that the documented movement patterns are representative of the stock, further satellite tracking studies are needed.</p><p>Another benefit of using satellite bio-logging tools is that they can provide other measures of behaviour. In the same study as described above, several fish exhibited repeated vertical rises between October and December south of the Grand Banks suggesting possible spawning grounds. The knowledge of these areas is important for stock management, in addition to providing samples for studies on age and length at maturity and fecundity (see Project II). Supported by results from the DFO RV groundfish trawl survey, the satellite tracking study also suggested that small halibut may occur in localized concentrations within the current stock boundaries with two persistent hotspots identified on the shelf edge, one in 4X and the other in 4VsW near the Gully, a Marine Protected Area.</p><p>Constraints to using satellite telemetry are cost, and therefore limited sample sizes, and a short battery life. Aquatic acoustic telemetry is a recent development in animal tracking whereby individuals carry acoustic tags that can be detected by fixed underwater receiver lines or by mobile receivers carried by free-ranging aquatic top predators (e.g., seals) and autonomous marine gliders. Given the lower cost per tag, many more individuals can be tagged providing greater confidence in stock movement patterns, and each tag has a lifespan of up to three years or more. Thus, although the detail of movement is less compared with satellite tags, the record of deployment is much longer providing measures of seasonal movement patterns, large scale dispersive movements that may demonstrate connectivity between subpopulations, and juvenile mortality. The use of acoustic technology becomes much more profitable and productive when multiple opportunities exist for tag detection, e.g. through collaborating with other projects that maintain multiple receiver lines or arrays. The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), based at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, maintains several large fixed receiver arrays on the Scotian Shelf, including the Halifax line. It is at the forefront of research using top predators as bioprobes and deploys Canada\u2019s largest operational fleet of autonomous marine gliders in support of its animal tracking and oceanographic research. This project will work closely with OTN to take advantage of their expertise and their infra-structure of fixed and mobile hydrophone arrays.</p><p>Overall, results from previous conventional and satellite tagging studies call for further research to determine the existence of stock subpopulations within the Scotian Shelf and southern Grand Banks management unit and confirm the identity of juvenile habitat and spawning areas. As previously discussed, data from conventional tagging are dependent upon the commercial fishery which, although operates year-round mostly takes place between May and July. Thus, all results and associated recommendations only reflect this time of year. Further research should therefore focus on bio-tracking tools that can provide representative and more detailed movement patterns of individuals within the stock. This approach will allow connectivity among regions within the Scotian Shelf and Grand Banks region to be measured, assess the importance of southwest Nova Scotia and the Gully as juvenile halibut, and identify spawning areas.</p><h3>Proposed research and how it will improve stock management&nbsp;</h3><p>This project will monitor the movement of undersized Atlantic halibut within and beyond known high abundance juvenile \u2018hotspots\u2019 using aquatic acoustic technology. Halibut are good candidates for acoustic tagging since they survive handling well, are long-lived and have low natural mortality. To record the movement of individuals, the project will deploy a hydrophone array within one of the juvenile hotspots and build upon the expertise and infrastructure of the Ocean Tracking Network to monitor more extensive movements and measure juvenile mortality. Data from deployed hydrophones can be collected through a remote download link which will take place once per year.</p><p>Deliverables of this project are:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>construct a 5 km by 5 km, 25-unit hydrophone array in either the Gully or Fundian Channel&nbsp;</li><li>deploy 150 acoustic tags on juvenile halibut within the defined juvenile \u2018hotspot\u2019 to monitor the movement of juveniles within the array to assess the degree of residency&nbsp;</li><li>identify the occurrence of larger scale dispersive movements through collaboration with OTN to quantify connectivity among juvenile \u2018hotspots\u2019&nbsp;</li><li>assess the survival of juvenile halibut over a three-year monitoring period</li></ol><p>Timeline \u2013 Acoustic telemetry&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Project start and end dates: September 2020 \u2013 August 2024&nbsp;</li><li>Deployment of acoustic array: summer/fall 2020&nbsp;</li><li>Deployment of acoustic tags on juvenile halibut: summer/fall 2020&nbsp;</li><li>Data retrieval trips: summer/fall 2021, 2022 and 2023&nbsp;</li><li>Recovery of acoustic array: summer/fall 2024&nbsp;</li><li>The project will be undertaken by a MSc (two years) and a PhD student (for four years)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Aquatic acoustic telemetry is useful to examine broad scale movements and those within a defined area but are less useful for providing detailed measures of behaviour, e.g. spawning, or identifying unknown areas of use.

Results from this work suggest halibut exhibit seasonal patterns of movement and that halibut show residency. However, results from conventional tagging are dependent upon the commercial fishery which mostly operates between May and July. Thus, results and associated recommendations from this work only reflect this time of year.</p><h3>How does this component integrate with the other components&nbsp;</h3><p>The identity of Atlantic halibut spawning areas is needed to inform sampling for the age-at-maturity and fecundity-at-size study.&nbsp;</p><p>The deployment of acoustic tags and a hydrophone array can be leveraged to study the tag reporting rate (Project I), discard mortality of halibut and potentially species discarded as part of the halibut fishery. Improved estimates of the tag reporting rate can be achieved by comparing the rate of return of high-reward acoustic tagged fish to the lower reward conventional t-bar anchor tags. Key to the understanding of the impact of changing minimum size and evaluating the impact of releasing large fish is a better understanding of discard mortality. The previous study of discard mortality examined only short-term mortality within tanks aboard a boat. This methodology may underestimate the true mortality because of the short observation time, or overestimate mortality due to the stress of captivity. The deployment of acoustic tags could also be extended to other discarded species of concern (e.g. skates, dogfish, etc.). Evaluation of discard mortality has been identified as a research priority by the International Pacific Halibut Commission.&nbsp;</p><p>Information on general habitat use and seasonal movements will also improve our understanding of the distribution of halibut relative to fishing effort which can have important implications into the management of the stock through impacts on selectivity and availability of fish to capture.</p>", "priorities": "", "deliverables": "<p>Deliverables of this project are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>50 PAT tags will be deployed on adult halibut to describe their seasonal movement and habitat use&nbsp;</li><li>deploy 25 mrPAT tags on a sub-group of deployed halibut to provide more accurate data on movement&nbsp;</li><li>examine vertical movements of halibut to identify the location and timing of spawning&nbsp;</li></ul><div><p>Deliverables of this project are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>construct a 5 km by 5 km, 25-unit hydrophone array in either the Gully or Fundian Channel&nbsp;</li><li>deploy 150 acoustic tags on juvenile halibut within the defined juvenile \u2018hotspot\u2019 to monitor the movement of juveniles within the array to assess the degree of residency&nbsp;</li><li>identify the occurrence of larger scale dispersive movements through collaboration with OTN to quantify connectivity among juvenile \u2018hotspots\u2019&nbsp;</li><li>assess the survival of juvenile halibut over a three-year monitoring period</li></ul></div>", "data_collection": "", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": null, "allotment_code": null, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": true, "meeting_notes": "", "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-04-02T17:21:34.852-03:00", "last_modified_by": 439, "programs": [70], "tags": [59, 37, 28], "existing_project_codes": []}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 658, "fields": {"year": 2021, "section": 34, "project_title": "AFF Project 5: Catch selectivity for species and length", "activity_type": 1, "functional_group": 10, "default_funding_source": 31, "is_national": false, "status": 1, "is_competitive": true, "is_approved": null, "start_date": "2020-07-01T00:00:00-03:00", "end_date": "2022-07-01T00:00:00-03:00", "description": "<h3>Background</h3><p>In align with monitoring the identity and quantity of bycatch, a sustainable fishery also needs to monitor changes to the size and sex composition of the target catch and bycatch. The premise of this study is the size of the fish hook may affect the size of the catch. Data on hook size in the observer database for both the fixed-station survey and commercial index sets suggest there may be a trend towards larger hook sizes (from 14 to 15 to 16) in the fishery in recent time. A change in the minimum legal size of halibut (for example moving from the current minimum legal size of 81 cm to a new value, e.g. 83 cm or 85 cm) may also lead to a shift to a larger hook size whereby fishers may increase the size of their hooks in an attempt to target relatively larger halibut. A trend toward a larger hook size may have an impact on the size- and age-composition of halibut caught and, given that halibut are sexually size-dimorphic, on the sex composition of the population.</p><p>Together, these changes will likely have implications for the stock\u2019s productivity and assessment. For example, if more females are being removed from the stock before their first spawning, or before they are afforded as many opportunities to spawn as usual, stock productivity may decline. Given the wide geographical size of the management unit and thus differing thermal habitat, and the effect of warmer temperatures on the growth rate of fish and size- and time- to maturity, the impact of a larger hook size on the stock will likely be geographically variable.</p><p>A larger fished hook size could also affect the composition of bycatch in terms of species caught, size and age, and their proportional makeup (relative to each other and to halibut). A recent examination of the species composition and proportion of the catch in the annual longline survey between 1998 to 2016 found that four bycatch species were listed under the Species at Risk Act and 14 were awaiting a listing decision based on assessments by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Thus, an understanding of the size and sex composition of the bycatch is important for the management of species whose populations are depleted.</p><h3>Proposed research and how it will improve stock management</h3><p>The deliverables of this project are:</p><ol><li>To evaluate the effect of hook size on the sex, size and age of halibut</li><li>To evaluate the consequences of changing the hook size to reduce or modify the bycatch</li><li>Given the strong interest from the industry, there may be a possibility to develop experimental fishery trials to look at using different hook sizes across the stock management area.

The survey was originally stratified into areas of low, medium and high catch based on data from commercial fishing logs between 1995 and 1997. Stratified estimates were used until 2009 when the stratification system was no longer utilized (although the strata were still part of the survey design). Starting in 2009, a standardized catch rate calculated from a negative binomial (NB) generalized linear model (GLM) replaced the stratified estimate of mean weight per standard longline set.</p><p>The simple stratified mean adjusted catch rate and the NB GLM both make certain assumptions on the nature of fishing: halibut are the only species being caught by the longline hooks, there is no competition for bait or hooks by other species and all hooks that do not have halibut are still capable of catching fish. However, a number of hooks will be occupied by species other than halibut and other hooks will be empty with bait still attached or missing. Smith, a retired DFO scientist who was contracted by the Council, recommended replacing the NB GLM with a multinomial model to account for both the number of halibut caught and the number of hooks occupied by other species or missing bait. The use of a multinomial hook occupancy model will allow us to explicitly account for the competition for bait by non-target species, and differences in the number of hooks that are still capable of catching halibut (i.e. those that still have bait).</p><p>The Atlantic Halibut longline survey was designed to provide an annual index of abundance (numbers or weights) to monitor the status of the stock for management purposes. Given the importance of this survey to the management of the halibut fishery, it is important to review both current and proposed statistical approaches for analyzing these data, particularly given recent advancements in analyses of fisheries data that vary in both space and time.

This model accounts for incomplete mixing of recently tagged individuals that have yet to randomly distribute within the population, an assumption of most CMR models. A key output of the capture-mark-recapture model is an estimate of the fishing and natural mortality, a critical element of stock management.</p><p>Since 2006, the Atlantic Halibut Council (AHC) has been tagging 3NOPs4VWX5Zc Atlantic halibut, for the most part in alternate years during the annual longline halibut survey (May to July) to provide input for the capture-mark-recapture program (known as the Halibut All Sizes Tagging (HAST) program). To date, approximately 8,000 fish have been tagged. Key aspects of the model are the probability an individual survives the tagging process, the retention-survival rate (i.e., the probability that a tag present at the start of the year after release will be present at the end of the year), and the tag reporting rate. The tag reporting rate is the fraction of tags reported of the fraction of tagged fish from the population that are caught. Tagging programs generally rely heavily on support</p><p>from the fishing industry. Fishers are asked to report the tag number(s), date of recapture, location of recapture, length, and sex of tagged Atlantic halibut caught during commercial fisheries or industry surveys. To encourage the reporting of tags, part of the science allocation of the quota in the DFO-Industry Collaborative Agreement (Use of Fish Agreement) supports cash rewards for reporting tags: $100/fish and four chances a year to be selected via a lottery for a $1000 reward, and to pay fishers to release the tagged halibut. In addition to providing estimates of annual survival, the reporting rate is also key to partitioning natural and fishing mortality.</p><p>Proposed research and how it will improve stock management</p><p>The reliability and robustness of the tagging results would be improved by increasing the rate of tagging, especially in light of the increasing population. It is proposed that tagging be conducted annually instead of biennially.</p><p>Historical tagging data, reporting and associated records provided by the Atlantic Halibut Council and DFO, and Citizen Science/Questionnaires (\u2018surveys\u2019) will be used by Memorial University to determine the reporting rate of recovered tags.&nbsp;</p><p>What has been achieved in the past</p><p>There have been several previous analyses of the HAST data to describe the movement and distribution of halibut within the Scotian Shelf-southern Grand Banks management unit and estimate population size. In the most recent analysis, almost 10% of reports were received without sufficient information on recovery date and could not be included in the analysis. Previous CMR models assumed a reporting rate of 0.9 (to account for the loss of 10% or reports) and 1.0.</p><p>How does this component integrate with the other components</p><p>Improved estimates of the reporting rate will contribute to achieving higher quality assessments of the exploitation rate and population size, and a better understanding of movement and distribution of halibut within the Scotian Shelf-southern Grand Banks management unit.</p>", "priorities": "", "deliverables": "<p>The deliverables for the project (which will encompass the requirements for an MSc thesis) will be:</p><p>1) Develop an estimate of (non-) reporting rates of recovered tags using Citizen Science surveys.

Understanding a species\u2019 reproductive strategy, and factors affecting fecundity, is critical to understanding stock reproductive potential. However, many key biological questions about reproduction and fecundity of halibut remain unanswered.</p><p>The size and age at which fish reach sexual maturity varies according to changes in fishing pressure, due to accelerated growth rates from a decrease in population density, and climate change, due to changes in the thermal regime and availability of food. Growth and maturity cycles of Atlantic halibut on the Scotian Shelf and southern Grand Banks have not been examined for some time with current estimates of age and size-at-maturity developed in the 1980s. Recent evidence suggests the Scotian Shelf - southern Grand Banks management unit is not a homogenous population but one that is comprised of sub-populations and with disconnected refugia for juveniles. Given the geographical size of the management unit, it is likely that individuals within face different thermal conditions and as a consequence distinct life history traits. Further, due to climate warming, sea temperature is expected to rise by 1.5 - 30C by 2060 thus it is vital to understand the consequences of a warming environment on rates of growth and consequences on fish life history. Given the Total Allowable Catch and landings of Atlantic halibut have increased since 1999, and the rate of climate change over the past several decades, it is entirely reasonable to suspect the current estimates of size and age at maturity are no longer representative of the current and entire stock. Thus, to ensure stock assessments of Atlantic halibut are truly representative, it is critical to ensure maturity estimates are current.</p><p>Body size has a strong influence on fecundity and larval production. In most fishes the relationship between body size and fecundity is non-linear, such that the number of eggs produced increases more rapidly than does mass. However, the shape of this relationship can be affected by increases in egg diameter with fish size such that the increase in fecundity can be lower than might initially be predicted.</p><p>spawning, i.e. when an individual fails to participate in a spawning season. Fish may skip spawning if environmental conditions are not suitable to support gonad development or poor body condition. Previous research suggests this occurs in Atlantic halibut. The degree to which halibut skip spawning will have an impact on the stock reproductive potential and subsequently influence population dynamics and resource management. This aspect of the study will examine the rate at which it occurs and whether it varies regionally and/or with size.</p><p>Proposed research and how it will improve stock management</p><p>This project to be undertaken by an Atlantic Canada university seeks to determine the current maturity ogives for male and female Atlantic halibut across the 3NOPs4VWX5Zc stock area.</p><p>1) Maturation will be assessed via histology given the recognized difficulties in using gross morphology to identify maturity stage of gonads. These results will help to improve the visual gonad staging key.</p><p>2) Spatial variation in fecundity-at-size will be examined. In most fishes the relationship between body size and fecundity is non-linear, such that the number of eggs produced increases more rapidly than does mass. Consideration of fecundity can improve stock assessments, and the predictions of future recruitment. Moreover, confirming fecundityat- size is also vital to investigating potential impacts on stock management with regards to the size of halibut that are to be retained.</p><p>3) Estimates of skipped spawning in Atlantic halibut across different areas and by size will be assessed.</p><p>4) The age of samples will be determined through measurements of otoliths. Once the otoliths have been aged, the age-length relationships for each sex, across NAFO subregions will be examined to see if there is regional variation in the length-at-age of Atlantic halibut. These data will also be compared to earlier work, to evaluate whether there has been a shift in length-at-age across sub-regions, over time, as the abundance of Atlantic halibut has increased. If the results suggest there has been a change in the agelength relationship relative to previous work, discussion and consideration of more frequent aging or the implementation of a regular aging program may be warranted.</p><p>Timeline</p><p>\u2022 Project start and end dates: September 2021 \u2013 August 2025</p><p>\u2022 The start date is dependent upon the HaliBT project identifying spawning areas</p><p>\u2022 The project will be undertaken by a PhD student (for four years)</p><p>What has been achieved in the past</p><p>Atlantic halibut otoliths have been collected intermittently from 1946 to present.

Since the Industry-DFO Halibut Survey started in 1998, roughly 2000 otoliths have been collected annually. Between 2006 and 2008, The Council funded work to age more than 2000 halibut otoliths collected from 1962-2007 from both otter trawl and longline catches. The data were used to develop age-length keys and to fit growth models. This work was duplicated in 2017-19, with age-length keys to be updated as appropriate. Collection of otoliths continues.</p><p>The collection of samples to evaluate age at maturity and fecundity at size is constrained due to the timing of the research surveys. The Scotian Shelf and Bay of Fundy (4VWX) DFO Maritimes summer RV survey has low catchability for larger (&gt;81 cm) halibut and is therefore not suitable for an assessment of maturity. The median size of halibut caught in the 4VWX summer RV surveys is between 40 and 50 cm and these fish will not enter the fishery for another two to four years. The annual longline halibut survey takes place during the summer when halibut are not spawning, thus again this survey is not suitable to assess fecundity.</p><p>How does this component integrate with the other components</p><p>Given that the regions of spawning in Atlantic halibut are largely unknown, the sampling of halibut to assess age-at-maturity and fecundity-at-size will be dependent upon the results from the HaliBT research (see below). This program will use satellite and acoustic biologging to identify the timing and geographical regions of spawning of halibut on the Scotian Shelf and southern Grand Banks. Once identified, the collection of reproductively active halibut may take place.</p>", "priorities": "", "deliverables": "", "data_collection": "", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": null, "allotment_code": null, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": false, "meeting_notes": "", "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-03-30T10:57:41.503-03:00", "last_modified_by": 466, "programs": [92], "tags": [], "existing_project_codes": []}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 665, "fields": {"year": 2021, "section": 34, "project_title": "AFF Project 4: Video monitoring pilot project", "activity_type": 1, "functional_group": 10, "default_funding_source": 31, "is_national": false, "status": null, "is_competitive": false, "is_approved": null, "start_date": "2020-07-01T00:00:00-03:00", "end_date": "2022-07-01T00:00:00-03:00", "description": "<p>Background</p><p>The groundfish fishery on the Scotian Shelf and southern Grand Banks is a multi-species fishery with licence conditions that allow the retention and landing of many species such as Atlantic halibut, Atlantic cod, white hake, haddock, and Greenland halibut. Increasingly, fisheries are managed with an ecosystem approach to support both the ecosystem and the fishery. An important step is to identify and quantify the level of bycatch in fisheries.</p><p>The Atlantic Halibut fishery has Marine Stewardship Council certification which places emphasis on sustainability. One of the three guiding principles of the MSC is for fisheries to harvest while maintaining productive and diverse ecosystems. Bycatch can be assessed through observers aboard commercial fishing vessels. At-sea observers monitor and record fishing activities in greater detail than can be obtained from fishery monitoring documents submitted by fishermen. However, observer coverage in the commercial halibut fishery by smaller fixed gear vessels averages well below 5% and what is available does not match well with the seasonal distribution of the fishery. While the proportion of non-target species in the catch of the halibut-directed longline fishery has been decreasing, with an increasing halibut Total Allowable Catch, the total catch of nontarget species could increase.</p><p>The establishment of an at-sea observation system may become even more important as the marine environment continues to warm and species abundance and distribution changes. A recent study suggests that by 2060 with an increase of 1.5 to 30C, the realised thermal habitat of many marine species will be impacted with the effect dependent upon the range of the species. Thus, with a warming climate one may expect the composition of the catch in a fishery to change. A reliable system for monitoring this change over the long term would therefore be beneficial to ensuring the sustainability of the ecosystem and fish stocks within.</p><p>This project proposes a pilot study to examine the feasibility of using video monitoring equipment to collect information on hook-occupancy, bycatch and size composition in the commercial halibut fishery as well as the longline survey. Information on size composition of halibut and bycatch will inform the catchability at size curve for halibut and other species, which would be critical information for stock assessment. The feasibility of using video monitoring to provide more representative area- and fleet-wide sampling of the commercial fishery will also be explored. Bycatch and catch of halibut in observed trips will be used to develop a ratio estimator which could be used to scale the bycatch to the level of the fishery. If possible, differences in bycatch composition/amounts by area, season and by gear (e.g. hook size) will also be evaluated.</p><p>Proposed research and how it will improve stock management</p><p>This project will explore the feasibility of using Electronic Video Monitoring (EVM) in the 3NOPs4VWX5Zc Atlantic Halibut commercial longline fishery and in the annual longline survey. This would be assessed by affixing cameras and collecting data from two or three volunteer boats. The deliverables of this project are:</p><p>1. assess whether EVM can provide the necessary biological information to determine the primary index of biomass for halibut, in conjunction with port sampling, where necessary</p><p>2. assess whether EVM can provide the biological information typically collected from other groundfish species caught during the survey</p><p>3. assess whether EVM can conduct some of the other sampling tasks normally undertaken by at-sea observers and in so doing create efficiencies in the longline survey, and allow for additional sampling and data collection to be completed by the observer</p><p>4. assess whether EVM can monitor bycatch, discards and species caught</p><p>5. assess whether EVM can monitor target species catch, and discards</p><p>6. whether observation coverage can be expanded into seasons and areas currently not well sampled by the survey, or by at-sea observers</p><p>7. assess whether EVM can leverage machine learning or other AI to expand the detail of sampling possible</p><p>It is anticipated that the video monitoring will both deliver better outcomes (i.e. improve overall rate of coverage in the fleet) and when observers are present, cover some of the more routine data collection to allow observers to focus on other priority data collection. Given that fixed-gear groundfish vessels are not meeting observer coverage targets, efficiencies gained through the use of EVM could provide for increased coverage. Experience gained by the halibut fleet will be valuable to other fleets and possibly encourage the adoption of EVM.</p><p>Timeline</p><p>\u2022 Project start and end dates: July 2020 \u2013 July 2022</p><p>\u2022 First deployment of EVM on two to three commercial vessels: fall 2020</p><p>What has been achieved in the past</p><p>Bycatch assessment of the Atlantic halibut fishery has been dependent on at-sea observers. However, observer coverage is limited and does not match well with the seasonal distribution of the fishery. A recent examination of the species composition and proportion of the catch in the annual longline survey between 1998 to 2016 found that 70% of the total catch by weight and 85% by number of individuals were bycatch. More than 100 species were identified including finfish, sharks, skates, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals, and seabirds. Four of these species are listed under the Species at Risk Act (Northern wolffish, spotted wolffish, Atlantic wolffish, and Atlantic cod), and 14 are awaiting a listing decision based on assessments by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Spatial patterns indicated high bycatch levels on the southern Scotian Shelf and southern edge of the Southern Grand Banks.</p><p>How does this component integrate with the other components</p><p>Video monitoring of the catch during survey and commercial halibut fishing would provide more representative area- and fleet-wide sampling. Importantly, it would also extend sampling to times of the year currently under sampled. In addition to providing valuable information on bycatch, the size composition of halibut could also be collected. This could help inform the catchability at size curve for halibut, which would be key information for the stock assessment and modeling of the effect of changing minimum size and voluntary release of large fish. At the same time, possible information on discard survival, especially of large halibut, could be obtained by examining the manner in which the fish are handled and released. These data would again inform the modeling of the effect of release of large fish.</p>", "priorities": "", "deliverables": "<p>The deliverables of this project are:</p><p>1. assess whether EVM can provide the necessary biological information to determine the primary index of biomass for halibut, in conjunction with port sampling, where necessary</p><p>2. assess whether EVM can provide the biological information typically collected from other groundfish species caught during the survey</p><p>3. assess whether EVM can conduct some of the other sampling tasks normally undertaken by at-sea observers and in so doing create efficiencies in the longline survey, and allow for additional sampling and data collection to be completed by the observer</p><p>4. assess whether EVM can monitor bycatch, discards and species caught</p><p>5. assess whether EVM can monitor target species catch, and discards</p><p>6. whether observation coverage can be expanded into seasons and areas currently not well sampled by the survey, or by at-sea observers</p><p>7. assess whether EVM can leverage machine learning or other AI to expand the detail of sampling possible</p>", "data_collection": "", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": null, "allotment_code": null, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": true, "meeting_notes": "", "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-04-02T17:21:35.494-03:00", "last_modified_by": 439, "programs": [92], "tags": [], "existing_project_codes": []}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 666, "fields": {"year": 2021, "section": 34, "project_title": "Halibut Longline Survey", "activity_type": 1, "functional_group": 10, "default_funding_source": 3, "is_national": false, "status": 2, "is_competitive": false, "is_approved": null, "start_date": "2020-04-01T00:00:00-03:00", "end_date": "2021-03-31T00:00:00-03:00", "description": "<p>Provide index of abundance for halibut assessment and platform for science projects</p>", "priorities": "", "deliverables": "", "data_collection": "", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "<p>industry survey database (ISDB)</p>", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "<p>updating and linking database (2 weeks)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "vehicle_needs": "<p>4 days a year to deliver materials, pick up supplies and attend meeting</p>", "it_needs": "<p>software for vemco minilogs</p>", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": 10013, "allotment_code": 3, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": true, "meeting_notes": "", "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-04-02T17:21:35.587-03:00", "last_modified_by": 478, "programs": [92], "tags": [59], "existing_project_codes": []}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 667, "fields": {"year": 2021, "section": 22, "project_title": "Historical vs. contemporary abundance of microplastics in the Gully Marine Protected Area", "activity_type": 2, "functional_group": 21, "default_funding_source": 2, "is_national": false, "status": 1, "is_competitive": false, "is_approved": false, "start_date": "2020-04-30T00:00:00-03:00", "end_date": "2020-08-31T00:00:00-03:00", "description": "<p>Plastic pollution is ubiquitous in the modern natural world;\r\nhowever, very little is known about the\r\nabundance, origin, and potential impacts of microplastics in Canada\u2019s various marine\r\nenvironments.

Although there has been recent expansion in capacity to deliver on these requirements (through implementation of regional MCT programs) there is much existing research experience and capacity within regional science that has not yet been effectively harnessed to assist with this large-scale ecosystem assessment challenge.</o:p></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><o:p>This project l</o:p>everages expert knowledge that Lawton and Cooper\r\nhave accumulated (as principal researchers on their individual projects and as\r\ncollaborators) to work with the Maritimes Region MCT team (led by Stanley) to adapt their existing coastal habitat survey approaches, and to implement a new regional-scale seabed imaging survey platform (Midwater video system), to inform coastal MPA network planning and the development of coastal monitoring approaches.&nbsp;Lawton has applied SCUBA and surface-deployed seabed imaging systems for coastal\r\nhabitat inventory extensively within the Maritimes Region (principally within the Bay of Fundy/SWNS) over the past 30 years. Cooper has applied similar SCUBA-based approaches, but also has extensive experience with&nbsp;benthic grab-, and trawl-based survey approaches for coastal\r\nbiodiversity assessment&nbsp; (13 years cumulative within the region). Both have extensive prior involvement in science advice provision related to MPA and MPA network planning.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">The project will provide the regional MCT team with valuable experience and training in the use of several coastal field survey approaches and technology systems. They will then be able to consider eventual integration into ongoing bioregional conservation network monitoring, for which the MCT team has the lead mandate. Specific objectives within the two - three year project are:</p><ol><li>In <b>Phase 1</b> (Year 1: 2020-21), continue with acquisition of equipment and system integration for deployment of the Mid-water seabed imaging system (drop camera system deployable to 200m) as a new regional coastal habitat survey tool. Based on work schedules within OETS, and availability of a test-bed configuration, conduct initial field tests (Sept - Oct 2020), staging the work from SABS.</li><li>In Year 1, Lawton and Cooper to participate in an initial field visit to the Eastern Shore AOI during planned summer survey work there by the MCT team. The group will evaluate field survey staging locations and conduct some initial scoping of SCUBA-based coastal habitat survey approaches.</li><li>In Year 1, develop full project proposal for a subsequent (<b>Phase 2</b>) 2 year project to ground-truth seabed habitat and biodiversity characteristics in the Eastern Shore Islands AOI and/or St. Anns Bank MPA (FY 2021-22&nbsp; to 2022-23).</li><li>Throughout the project timeline coordinate with, and involve OETS and ODIS on technical development of the new seabed imaging system, and integration of software systems for at-sea metadata capture for documenting coastal field survey\r\nmissions (seabed video, SCUBA, other survey approaches). This work builds upon existing relationships that have developed over the past 5 years through involvement of staff from these sections in field deployments of a current seabed imaging system developed by Lawton at SABS.</li></ol><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">This proposal integrates a previously approved investment in the development of a regional coastal seabed investigation platform (Mid-water seabed video system) with a proposed initial field test in FY 2020-21, and first field research application in FY 2021-22. For the initial scoping of this project activity we have not included additional personnel requests (term, casual, or contract), but it is anticipated the 2 year project proposal will require additional support for deployment, video processing, and data analysis. Phase 2 of the project will include video processing as a primary objective with delivery of data and data layers to Oceans Management at the conclusion of the project. The intent of the data products will be to guide the development of zoning assessments and ongoing monitoring to the study areas. Zoning, in particular, will be of particular necessity for the Eastern Shore Islands as that sites continues through the AOI design phase.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>", "priorities": "<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">This project is currently scoped as two phases. Initial work scoped for<b> Phase 1&nbsp;</b> involves&nbsp;the final integration work, and preliminary trials of the mid-water system. Pending the successful development of that system, and the approval for ongoing work, we will develop a full two year proposal (<b>Phase 2</b>) to deploy the mid-water system within the Eastern Shore Islands AOI and St. Anns Bank MPA. Priorities for each phase are outlined below:</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b>Phase 1 - Development, trials and training</b></p><ul><li><b>April\r\n\u2013 August 2020</b>: Lawton to work with OETS and ODIS staff on specification and purchasing of final components, and integration of imaging systems, electronics, and software towards completion of an initial test-bed configuration of the Mid-water system. This Mid-water system development has has been approved regionally and funded incrementally over the past three fiscal years as part of a 5-year integrated planning process. Some components from Lawton's existing drop camera system may be utilized in the first Mid-water system configuration; however, until the Mid-water system is fully operational, there is also a requirement to maintain capacity to use the current system (particularly if delays are experienced in the Mid-water system development).</li><li><b>August -September 2020</b>: Lawton and Cooper to participate in initial field survey in Eastern Shore Islands with MCT team (Stanley, plus one or two MCT/HES technical staff members). Depending on outcome of planning discussions the initial survey may include SCUBA-based survey approaches recently developed in work on Brier Island (Cooper et al. 2019), and/or use of a shallow water configuration of Lawton's drop camera system to augment spatial coverage in coastal habitats where subsequent SCUBA-based surveys may be implemented (0 - 20 m depth).</li><li><b>September \u2013 October 2020: </b>Phelan and Bentham to participate in 3 days of field trials (5 day travel overall) at SABS of a test-bed configuration of the Mid-water system. These trials will take advantage of prior extensive seabed survey coverage (depths to 80 m) obtained with a current drop camera system during previous (&gt; 100 deployments - Lawton and Cooper 2016; Mireault et al. In prep). As part of the evaluation of the field trials, seabed imagery obtained with the new system will be compared to prior data sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><div><b>Phase 2 - Deployment and new survey work (2 year project to start after FY 2020-21)</b></div><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">Project scoping and discussions with other potential collaborators within Maritimes Region, and external collaborators (A. Metaxas, C. Brown - Dalhousie University Department of Oceanography) will occur during FY 2019-20 leading to submission of a full proposal for a 2 year project to conduct new field surveys in the Eastern Shore Islands AOI and St. Anns Bank MPA, where seabed imaging survey approaches can address identified data gaps and contribute to the characterization of benthic habitat and species assemblages as part of bioregional conservation network planning and monitoring.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Eastern Shore Islands AOI:&nbsp;</strong>Characterize habitat heterogeneity with a specific focus on the spatial scale of habitat patchiness. Both habitat diversity and patchiness were identified as key ecological attributes of the AOI in the 2018 Ecological Overview; however, existing survey work to delimit and elucidate these characteristics is limited. Work within the AOI could leverage observations from SCUBA surveys and seabed imaging, building on methods developed during previous work on Brier Island (Cooper et al. 2019), and SW New Brunswick (SPERA project: Lawton and Cooper 2016; Canadian Healthy Oceans Network project: Mireault et al. In prep.). Given the complexity of benthic habitats expected within the Archipelago and the AOI, this data will provide an invaluable basis for future monitoring and development of the AOI (i.e., zoning, risk assessments).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>St. Anns Bank MPA:&nbsp;</strong>Extensive effort was placed during the development of the MPA to conduct multibeam acoustic surveys to map and characterize the seabed physical environment, based on bathymetry and backscatter (seabed type) data analysis. Combining these physical environment attributes with seabed biodiversity data from 110 seabed image survey stations, an initial benthoscape classification was developed for the AOI (Lacharite et al. 2018). We propose to use the Mid-water seabed survey system to expand on prior groundtruthing of benthic assemblage characteristics and specifically focus on areas where observation data was limited in the northeastern Sector of the MPA (Initial 100 kHz survey work conducted by the M/V Dominion in 2013). In addition to expanding on existing seabed imaging survey data, we propose developing a preliminary study of the nearshore reaches of MPA, northeast of Scaterie Island, that has not yet been surveyed. This work will further characterize benthic habitats which will help to guide ongoing and future monitoring efforts within the MPA.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\"><b>References</b></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">Cooper, J.A., Goodwin, C., Lawton, P., Brydges, T., Hiltz, C., Armsworthy, S., and McCurdy, Q.\r\n2019.

Geospatial information on species presence and/or abundance derived from analysis of optical imagery from seabed surveys is used to model species distribution patterns against physical environmental variables. These surveys and analyses support key renewed departmental mandates such as the development of a national marine conservation network, as well as OPP and Fisheries Act habitat provisions.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, there are significant current technical issues, and a lack of coordination across DFO regions, to effectively support continued use of prior department-developed image analysis tools. Additionally, in the absence of a mechanism to exchange experience and best practices, there have been lost opportunities to develop more integrated national approaches. It can be anticipated that the use of seabed optical seabed surveys will continue to expand.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This proposal stems from initial discussion within Maritimes Region (involving CESD, OESD, OETS, ODIS) on the inability to mount a key image analysis program ClassActMapper on Windows 10 systems. Before deciding on regional approaches to adapt this program, Science user representatives (Lawton, Beazley) were asked to consult with other DFO regions to determine if alternative software might be available.

Decadal-scale perspective on coastal habitat use by lobsters: relative distributions on sediment-dominated vs rock-dominated habitats&nbsp;</b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is a current collaboration with UNB Saint John (Rochette Lab) and co-supervision of PhD student Kristin Dinning through Lawton's Adjunct position at UNB. Her project addresses the suitability of different coastal habitat types (sediment-dominated habitats vs rock-dominated habitats) for both seasonal and inter- annual utilization by different life history stages of lobsters. Her work is focused in the Maces Bay area and this specific component of her research takes advantage of a unique data set on lobster habitat occupation within this coastal system from prior DFO SCUBA diver transect-based sampling (1990-93; 2000-02). Lawton has made this data-set available to UNB, and in collaboration with Rochette and Dinning we started a new two year survey effort to reoccupy a subset of historical DFO dive locations. An initial series of dive surveys were completed in 2019, but a further 5-day survey effort is projected for 2020 to complete a data set that will permit Dinning to undertake her decadal-scale analysis on coastal habitat use. For Lawton, this represents a significant mentoring opportunity in supporting a junior researcher's career development.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>2. Annual lobster&nbsp;settlement monitoring program</b></p><p>Annual lobster settlement monitoring conducted in Beaver Harbour is the longest-running Canadian study area (29 years) within a multi-region collaborative program spanning from Rhode Island to Newfoundland (over 120 sampling sites; two dozen study areas). Within Canada it is also now the longest running continuous fishery independent survey on lobster recruitment patterns. The Atlantic Lobster Settlement Index is unique in its geographic scope, involvement of multiple US and Canadian government agencies, state and provincial departments, and academic institutions to conduct standardized sampling of annual lobster settlement strength and its relationship to oceanographic and fishery driving factors. To maintain the Beaver Harbour SCUBA survey effort only a modest investment of time and O&amp;M is required (18 person-days for the minimum set of sample sites; $1 - $2K O&amp;M). Why document this small level of investment in the project planning system? Since FY 2018-19, the project lead (Lawton) does not have any discretionary O&amp;M A-base funding (or personnel) which historically supported this ongoing initiative. Similarly, prior investments from PED, provided by Gaudette in his role as Lobster Biologist for Bay of Fundy LFAs, were put in put into question in 2019.</p><p>In undertaking 2019 diving field-work to support both projects, questions were raised within CESD and PED management about the personnel investment required. Overall field support requested was 9 person-days from CESD and 15 person-days from PED. Lawton contributed a total of 8 field days, participating in all diving days, and a further 10 person days on other project support, bringing the overall CESD involvement to 27 person days.</p><p>These projects are submitted into the planning system to identify issues related to transition planning (eg for maintaining the settlement time series), and also because in undertaking the field program significant opportunities were provided to technicans and biologists at SABS to gain additional field expertise (eg boat handling), or to maintain DFO SCUBA proficiency. As I have experienced issues in arguing for the maintenance of these types of projects with local management I asked my two principal academic collaborators (Rochette and Wahle) for their independent commentary on the value of this DFO survey effort in the lower Bay of Fundy.

Although it has been an active fishery for more than the last 150 years, within the last 30 years there has been a doubling of total landings in many areas. Accompanying this change, the socioeconomic reliance on this fishery has increased in many coastal communities (e.g. Greenan et al. 2019). A combination of environmenal, ecosystem and fisheries drivers have likely caused the recent increase in lobster landings. In particular, the demise of the groundfish, considered an important predator of young lobster, in the late 1980s and early 1990s coincides with the increase in lobster (Boudreau and Worm 2010). An increase in bottom water temperature around the same time has also been suggested to have played an important role. Additionally, there has been a number of fisheries conservation efforts put in place that have likely impacted lobster productivity (Cook et al. 2018). Recent work by Lebris et al (2018) examined the relative impacts of these factors on lobster fisheries in southern New England (SNE) and the Gulf of Maine (GoM) where the systems diverge in both bottom temperature and whether proactive conservation measures were adopted. Results suggested that the combination of the conservation measures, which protected a significant component of the spawning population ,along with increased bottom temperatures lead to the higher productivity in the GoM. In the SNE where bottom temperatures were higher and no conservation measures were adopted, environmentally induced recruitment failure and no buffering from a protected adult stock led to the demise of the fishery. This two system comparison allowed the delineation in the role of conservation on the continued population increase in the GoM.&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to the SNE \u2013 GoM comparison, there are contrasting systems in the Canadian lobster stocks in terms of environmental conditions, ecological pressures and fisheries conservation. Furthermore, there are strong connections between the lobster stocks across international borders with Canada on the eastern GoM and the US on the west. This project seeks to build upon the work of Lebris et al. (2018) by expanding the study across the species range and determining the relative contribution of conservation measures and environmental conditions to the observed increases in lobster productivity. By performing these studies, we should be better prepared to anticipate changes in stock productivity and better positioned to provide advice on the appropriate conservation measures to minimize rates of decline in future.</p><p>Project Plan:</p><p>1) Developing indices of effective effort</p><p>Much of the information on the increases in lobster productivity comes from the long time series of fisheries landings. As lobster fisheries are input controlled rather than output or total allowable catch (TAC) controlled, it has presumed that landings are largely reflective of available biomass. Studies have revealed changes in fishing behaviour over time as lobster fishing became more profitable and other fisheries have collapsed (Fogarty 1995). These changes have resulted in increased fishing effort and/or fishing efficiency which would result in higher total landings independent of the changes in population biomass.&nbsp;</p><p>Developing an inventory of regional timelines on the changes to the fisheries both in behaviour and through management controls will provide the information necessary to standardize the landings time series. In order to complete this component, a thorough literature review including archival information will be completed. Supplementary interviews and questionaires of harvesters will provide specific details in order to quantify the frequency and timing of changes in fishing behaviours. This information will be used to develop regional and temporal measures of effective effort with which to standardized the landings time series.&nbsp;</p><p>Requirements: Collaboration with social scientists to develop effective interview and questionaire materials.

Once sufficient model validations are complete, further simulation testing under projected climate scenarios and fisheries management strategy evaulation (MSE) will be performed.</p><p>Requirements: Collaboration with academic and government scientists and resource managers in both Canada and US on population, oceanographic and bioeconomic modelling.

The\r\nresults of this research will be disseminated through a publicly accessible web\r\nsite to be used by coastal engineers designing SCH infrastructure.</p><div>&nbsp;<br />\r\n\r\nIt is critical to understand that the amount of\r\nsea level change which will be experienced along Canada\u2019s coastline varies\r\nconsiderably. Since SCH infrastructure must remain\r\nat the coast to provide essential services to fishing communities (e.g.,\r\ninfrastructure for landing catch), the primary adaptation strategy will be to employ\r\nadjustments to the height of infrastructure. In some cases, there may be\r\nsituations where additional climate change-related impacts (e.g., erosion,\r\nsediment transport) will need to be addressed through supplementary adaptation\r\nstrategies and tools, however, these impacts of climate change are outside the\r\nscope of this proposal.\r\n\r\n<p>DFO\r\nScience has developed the Canadian Extreme Water Level Adaptation Tool\r\n(CAN-EWLAT, <a href=\"http://www.bio.gc.ca/science/data-donnees/can-ewlat/index-en.php\">http://www.bio.gc.ca/science/data-donnees/can-ewlat/index-en.php</a>)\r\nto provide SCH with advice on how much higher to build wharves and breakwaters\r\nto accommodate expected&nbsp;changes in sea level at all marine SCH\r\nlocations in Canada; this height is called the vertical allowance and is\r\nreferenced to a present-day water level baseline. The vertical allowance also\r\nincorporates past water level history of extreme water level (e.g., from storm\r\nsurges) along with future sea level rise projections from climate models that\r\ncontributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment\r\nReport 5 (AR5).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present-day water level baseline is\r\nprovided by the Canadian Hydrographic Service\u2019s (CHS) Continuous Vertical Datum\r\nfor all Canadian Waters (CVDCW) surfaces.&nbsp;\r\nThe accuracy of the CVDCW surfaces is dependent on the data and methods\r\nused to create them, which includes regional ocean models, satellite altimetry,\r\nNRCan\u2019s national Geoid separation model and shore-based water level\r\nobservations. As with any science-based product, the rapid advances in the\r\nfield of computer modeling present an opportunity to significantly improve the\r\nCVDCW. While we have not yet identified gaps in the water level data archive,\r\nit is generally known within CHS that there are areas for which there is either\r\nvery limited data or that the data collected are not very recent and,\r\ntherefore, do not reflect the mean water level very well.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are proposing to increase the accuracy of vertical\r\nallowances in CAN-EWLAT by improving the present-day mean water level baseline\r\nCVDCW surfaces through 1) incorporation of new ocean model results into their\r\nsolutions, and 2) by carrying out additional acquisition of water level data at\r\nkey locations (as determined by the gap analysis) along Canada\u2019s coastline\r\nusing temporary tide gauge installations. The details of the work activities\r\nare provided in Section 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Improving baseline CVDCW surfaces would\r\nleverage existing CHS activities underway to support the Ocean Protection Plan\r\n(OPP). By improving the estimates for vertical allowances at SCH sites, we will\r\nprovide more robust recommendations for changes in wharf and breakwater heights\r\nto reduce the risk of flooding in the future. These improvements will directly\r\nbenefit federal infrastructure through inclusion of climate change\r\nconsideration is future design decisions. While this adaptation tool was\r\ninitially targeted at DFO SCH sites, the results of this work will benefit all\r\nFederal infrastructure along Canada\u2019s coastline. The science advice provided by\r\nCAN-EWLAT could accommodate other Federal infrastructure sites such as DND Navy\r\nbases, National Parks, etc. with a very modest level of effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DFO Small Craft Harbours is currently evaluating\r\noptions for four locations in the Arctic (Grise Fiord, Resolute Bay, Arctic Bay\r\nand Clyde River \u2013 all sites in Nunavut) as potential future locations for SCH\r\ninfrastructure.

Wong and colleagues suggests that both high temperature events and increased turbidity are key climate change stressors for eelgrass. &nbsp;Beds in certain environmental conditions are thought to be more vulnerable to these disturbances than others.&nbsp; However, eelgrass vulnerability to climate change has yet to be fully evaluated within a comprehensive framework that includes key features of resilience (i.e., reproduction, reserves, genetic diversity, environmental conditions).&nbsp; The inability to identify resilient eelgrass beds has considerable implications for DFO programs that aim to protect habitats for the long term (MCT), evaluate habitat damage and recovery (FFHPP), and reduce human conflicts with sensitive habitat (DFO-MSP).&nbsp; Here we will build on our past work to characterize the resilience of eelgrass to climate change by examining their reproductive capacity, energy reserves, and genetic diversity (through whole genome sequencing) across environmental gradients.&nbsp; We will create novel thermal and turbidity risk indices for nationwide and global seagrass ecosystems, to identify key areas of vulnerability.&nbsp; We will also use an ecosystem growth model to predict eelgrass resilience to various climate change scenarios relevant to all of Canada's coasts.&nbsp; These aspects will be evaluated to understand resilience of eelgrass to climate change across different spatial scales.&nbsp; This work will allow informed decision making to ensure long term preservation of nearshore habitats and their associated ecosystem services in a rapidly changing environment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p><p>Our objective is to characterize the vulnerability and resilience of eelgrass beds to climate change.&nbsp; Focus will be on two climate change stressors, high temperature and turbidity events, shown previously to impact eelgrass beds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>Specifically, we will:&nbsp;&nbsp;<ol><li>Evaluate the components of resilience (reproductive capacity, energy reserves, genetic diversity, supporting environment) across environmental gradients,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Develop novel indices of thermal and turbidity risk and create risk maps regionally, nationally, and globally,&nbsp;</li><li>Use an ecosystem growth model to predict long term resilience under different climate scenarios, and&nbsp;</li><li>Combine this information to identify areas and conditions that support resilient eelgrass beds.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p></div>", "priorities": "<p>The project-specific priorities for 2020-2021 are to evaluate the resilience components of reproductive capacity, energy reserves, and supporting environment.&nbsp; We will also develop the thermal and turbidity risk indices and maps for the region.&nbsp; Both of these activities will be primarily based on already available field data, augmented by some new data collections.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>", "deliverables": "<p>Deliverables:</p><p>\r\n\r\nY1:&nbsp; Technical report/primary publication on reproductive capacity and energy\r\nreserves; Thermal and turbidity risk indices and regional risk maps</p><p>\r\n\r\nY2:&nbsp; Technical report/primary publication on genetic diversity; Technical Report/primary publication on eelgrass model\r\npredictions, National and global thermal and turbidity risk maps</p><p>\r\n\r\nY3:&nbsp; Technical report/primary publication on overall assessment of eelgrass resilience; presentation for interested clients (FFHPP, PIER, OCEANS, MSP, MCT)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "data_collection": "<p>Most data is already collected, and includes temperature, turbidity, PAR, water currents, and plant data (reproductive and carbohydrate data).&nbsp; New genetic data will also be obtained.</p>", "data_sharing": "<p>Data will be placed on FGP or other appropriate platforms after publication.&nbsp; We anticipate data associated with Y1 deliverables will be made available by the end of Y1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "data_storage": "<p>Data will be stored and archived on NAS storage systems, SSD, shared drives, and the cloud.&nbsp; We are in communication with both Peter Kraska and Tobias Spears on these issues and are forming a long term plan for data storage associated with M.

Since its designation, a large amount of data is regularly collected from the Gully MPA, but it remains unknown if this data is adequate to fully monitor the system, and if any other data collection is required to understand the Gully system.

A DFO scientific peer review of existing monitoring outcomes has been required as a foundation for reporting on the performance of the MPA. This review will aid discussion on indicators and objectives that are being addressed within the monitoring program, as well as what they reveal about the MPA ecosystem approximately 15 years post-implementation. The review will also prioritize future monitoring effort, identifying gaps or opportunities for modifications, to advance efficiency and effectiveness of future monitoring and hence of understanding of MPA status and performance.&nbsp;</p><p>As the Scotian Shelf Regional MPA Network continues to develop, information describing connections between the Gully and existing or proposed network sites is needed to describe how monitoring at the site level can contribute to network evaluation.

The marine ecosystems to the north and south of the Canada-USA border\r\nare not separate entities, but are rather contiguous shared dynamic networks of\r\ninteracting species, subject to a range of pressures including fishing and\r\nenvironmental change. Some species are moving north as a result of warming\r\nwater temperatures due to climate change (REFS) and other species, such as grey\r\nseals and halibut are moving south due to population growth and range\r\nexpansion.</p><p>\r\n\r\nClimate change will impact marine ecosystems\r\nvia changes in the physical conditions of the oceans (temperature, hydrological\r\ncycles and circulation patterns, increases in CO2 and declines in dissolved O2\r\nconcentrations), which will be transmitted to the biological ecosystem through\r\nchanges in distribution, productivity, life history traits, phenological\r\nchanges, trophic interactions etc. Ecosystems are interconnected and\r\nvulnerability to climate change impacts has been identified across all trophic\r\nlevels (Shackell et al 2014). Marine ecosystems will change as a result of\r\nclimate change, resulting social and economic impacts for fisheries.\r\nAnticipating and planning for this change is mandatory.</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhole ecosystem models have been separately\r\ndeveloped for USA and Canadian waters on their respective sides of the Hague\r\nLine. In Canada, Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) models have been developed for the\r\nwestern Scotian shelf, including the Bay of Fundy (Araujo et al. 2012) and for\r\nthe eastern Scotian Shelf (Bundy et al. 2005). Similarly, EwE models were\r\ndeveloped in the US for the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank (Link et al. 2006)\r\nunder the Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis eXercise (EMAX) program and the Georges\r\nBank model has since been further developed (Lucey 2019) with future\r\ndevelopment of the Gulf of Maine model currently underway. Lucey et al (in\r\nreview) have developed a version of EwE in R (RPath).&nbsp; Rpath offers a wide range of benefits to\r\nusers including the ability to link multiple EwE models together. &nbsp;&nbsp;Functionality has been added that allows the\r\nmodel to track emigration into and out of the system so that biomass can be\r\ntracked across models.</p><p>\r\n\r\nIn 2019, it makes even less sense to have\r\nseparate ecosystem models for this area that it did when they were first\r\ndeveloped. In an era where the effects of climate change can no longer be\r\nignored, studies have shown that species are predicted to move north along the\r\nNE US coast into Canada with warming water temperatures. However, these studies\r\nonly predict the movement of individual species but do not model the ecological\r\ninteractions between them.

The general goal for this proposal is to prepare well for the use of SWOT data in DFO research and operations when SWOT data become available.&nbsp;</p><p>The specific objectives are (1) To improve knowledge on coastal oceanographic processes such as tides, fronts, and storm surges; (2) To understand the dynamics and kinematic processes of sub-mesoscale and mesoscale processes, including eddies, currents, ocean waves, etc., their role in ocean transport and circulation, and their feedbacks to the atmosphere. (3) To improve accuracy of ocean circulation models by developing techniques that blend SWOT data with model dynamics.&nbsp;</p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b><b>&nbsp;</b><p class=\"MsoNormal\">As a maritime\r\nnation surrounded by the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific Oceans, the Government of\r\nCanada is obliged and committed to understand ocean processes and their\r\ninfluence on our environment, ecosystems and coastal communities. Fisheries and\r\nOceans Canada (DFO) has the responsibility for fulfilling Government of\r\nCanada\u2019s obligation and commitment through research and monitoring of key oceanographic\r\nvariables, such as sea level and ocean currents. The oceanographic monitoring\r\nand research support a wide range of societal needs such as emergency preparedness\r\nand responses, search and rescue operations, at-sea operations for fisheries\r\nand offshore energy, and climate change adaptation. They also enable the DFO to\r\nassess the health of Canada\u2019s oceans, determine the productivity of marine\r\necosystems and contribute to the provision of scientific advice on commercial\r\nfisheries.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Canada has vast\r\ncoast zones and continental shelves that feature harsh environmental\r\nconditions, complicated physical processes, diverse ecosystems and rich\r\nhydrocarbon resources. It is challenging and very costly for DFO to install and\r\nmaintain sufficient field instruments across Canada\u2019s oceans. At the present,\r\nthere are only very limited long-term tide-gauge stations for sea level\r\nobservations and almost no long-term current measurements. As a result, many important\r\nphysical processes, including coastal jets, fronts, and sub-mesoscale features,\r\nare not well observed or understood. The advent of nadir altimetry such as\r\nTOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3, Crostat2, SARAL/Altika, and\r\nSentinel-3 has provided new capacity for coastal ocean monitoring, but its low\r\ncross-track resolution does not allow us to resolve coastal processes. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Surface Water\r\nand Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission can provide spatial sampling adequate to resolve\r\nimportant submesoscale features and coastal processes (Fu, 2003; Fu and\r\nUbelmann, 2014) with unprecedented accuracy. The assimilation of SWOT sea\r\nsurface slope data into a regional ocean model introduces dynamic and kinematic\r\nconstraints into the analyzed sea level and surface circulation (Gaultier et\r\nal., 2016). The full analysis fields can be validated against various in situ\r\ndata sets available from the Canadian coastal observational programs, such as\r\nthe Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (Therriault et al., 1998). Collocations\r\nwith polarimetric imagery from RADARSAT-2 SAR potentially allow verification of\r\nSWOT-detected processes, particularly those related to retrievals of sea\r\nsurface temperature fronts, mesoscale eddies, waves, and marine winds. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Prior to the\r\nlaunch of SWOT, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has launched a series of ocean\r\nsatellite missions focused on synthetic aperture radar (SAR): RADARSAT-1 in\r\n1995, RADARSAT-2 in 2007, and RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), which\r\nconsists of three new SAR satellites, to be launched in late 2019. Until RCM,\r\nthe RADARSAT-1/2 missions were not able to provide routine estimates of surface\r\ncurrents. RCM will offer daily coverage of the global ocean and up to four\r\ntimes coverage of the coastal oceans surrounding Canada, particularly polar\r\nregions. The rapid RCM revisit frequency introduces a range of applications\r\nthat are possible through the creation of composite images that highlight\r\nchanges with time. These applications are particularly useful for monitoring\r\nthe evolution of eddies, their interactions with ocean circulation processes,\r\npossibly including energy cascades to smaller scales. In addition, RCM will\r\nhave a Doppler processor, which opens a door to retrieval models and thus,\r\nhigh-resolution observations of ocean surface currents.&nbsp; The Doppler information can provide total\r\nradial surface velocity (Ekman current &amp; wind friction drift, Stoke drift,\r\ngeostrophic current, tidal etc.), which is different from geostrophic or\r\nquasi-geostrophic currents&nbsp; obtained from\r\nSWOT\u2019s SSH data, because it includes contributions from all surface motions.\r\nThe latter will probably include the velocity of sub-mesoscale processes, which\r\nas mentioned above, do not obey quasi-geostrophic theory (Capet et al., 2008;\r\nMcWilliams et al. 2016). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under\r\nthe SWOT \u2013 Canada (SWOT-C) program, managed by the Canadian Space Agency, DFO\r\nscientists have carried out research and development in preparation for SWOT\r\nsince 2013.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>REFERENCES:</b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Capet,\r\nX., McWilliams, J.

Different scenarios of\r\npathogen and parasite releases from salmon aquaculture sites representing\r\ndifferent management interventions (i.e., vaccination, pesticides,\r\ndepopulation, siting) will be compared to determine the efficacy of these interventions\r\nin reducing the risk of disease transfer from salmon aquaculture to wild\r\nsalmon.<br />&nbsp;<br />4)&nbsp;Risk assessment<br />We will develop a quantitative\r\nframework for assessing the risk of disease transfer from farmed salmon to wild\r\nsalmon using a Bayesian Network.&nbsp;The advantages of this approach\r\nare that it explicitly accounts for the uncertainty associated with each step\r\nof the analysis and can incorporate both quantitative and qualitative data (i.e.,\r\nexpert judgments, traditional ecological knowledge).</p>", "priorities": "<p>This is a three-year project with:\r\nyear 1 (2019-2020) dedicated to the development and refinement of the salmon migration\r\nmodel (Objective 1), year 2 (2020-2021) dedicated to modeling the dispersal of pathogens\r\n(Objective 2) and assessing the encounter rates of salmon with pathogens\r\n(Objective 3), and year 3 (2021-2022) dedicated to the development of the quantitative risk\r\nassessment framework.</p><ul><li>April-September 2019: Development\r\nof a salmon migration model for the 2018 field data</li><li>October 2019-March 2020:\r\nRefinement of the salmon migration model for the 2019 field data</li><li>March 2020: Annual Report\r\nsubmitted</li><li>April-September 2020: Development\r\nof a pathogen dispersal model for the 2018 and 2019 field data</li><li>October 2020-March 2021: Modeling\r\nthe encounter probability of salmon and pathogens originating from salmon farms</li><li>March 2021: Annual Report\r\nsubmitted</li><li>April 2021-March 2022: Development\r\nof a quantitative risk assessment framework</li><li>March 2022: Annual Report\r\nsubmitted</li></ul>", "deliverables": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A final report describing the risk\r\nposed by disease from salmon aquaculture to the recovery of endangered salmon\r\npopulations. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This report will be submitted to\r\nboth the Species At Risk Recovery Planner for the Maritimes Region as well as\r\nto DFO managers at the Aquaculture Management Division.

This focused and specific Petitcodiac salmon restoration effort led by FFHR, in partnership with DFO, is comprised of three separate but related activities implemented to conserve IBoF population genetic characteristics and re-establish self-sustaining populations to IBoF rivers. MBF captive spawns and rears BSR fish from the pedigree supported IBoF LGB program and provides FFHR with non-priority individuals at juvenile and adult life stages for release into the Petitcodiac River to assist with population recovery by maximizing juvenile production and adult abundance. FFHR also annually collects wild exposed juvenile salmon from Petitcodiac River tributaries to be protectively reared at MBF until smoltification. After spending at least a year growing in sea cages at the Dark Harbour (DH) marine conservation farm, these fish are released back into the Petitcodiac River as mature adults to spawn naturally, and contribute to the production of the next generation of wild origin IBoF Salmon. It has long been hypothesized that the Petitcodiac River Atlantic salmon population was important to the persistence of the IBoF DU likely due to the watershed historically containing a large amount of productive freshwater habitat. The recent restoration of tidal flow and fish passage on the Petitcodiac River presents an opportunity for DFO to examine this river\u2019s potential contribution to IBoF recovery. Given that Atlantic salmon were extirpated from the Petitcodiac River after the construction of a causeway in 1968, re-establishing a self-sustaining population requires a donor stock - surplus IBoF LGB BSR fish. Opportunistic releases of non-target BSR salmon from the LGB program into the Petitcodiac River and the ongoing collection, rearing, and release of Petitcodiac wild origin and wild exposed salmon utilizes a combination of strategies for population recovery. The results of the project will be used to inform future IBoF Atlantic salmon recovery efforts including those specific to the Petitcodiac River.</p>", "priorities": "", "deliverables": "", "data_collection": "", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": 10023, "allotment_code": null, "feedback": "", "submitted": false, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": false, "meeting_notes": null, "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-01-11T18:37:44.011-04:00", "last_modified_by": 838, "programs": [22], "tags": [61, 11], "existing_project_codes": []}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 770, "fields": {"year": 2021, "section": 39, "project_title": "Medium and high resolution Satellite Observations of the physical and biogeochemical marine environment to address resilience of the Marine Ecosystem under Climate Change (SO-MECC)", "activity_type": 2, "functional_group": 36, "default_funding_source": 2, "is_national": false, "status": 2, "is_competitive": true, "is_approved": null, "start_date": "2018-04-01T00:00:00-03:00", "end_date": "2021-03-31T00:00:00-03:00", "description": "<p><u>Description:</u></p><p>DFO is committed to understanding and protecting the oceans through\r\nscientific-based evidence, sustainable management of fisheries and the marine\r\necosystem.

The Gaspereau River has an Alewife population that is fished commercially as the fish ascend rivers to spawn. This population is the most-studied river herring population in the Maritimes Region. In addition to the commercial fishery, the alewife population is also impacted by hydroelectric generation. Alewife must ascend two fish ladders to reach the spawning areas in Gaspereau Lake, and juveniles and post-spawning adults and must&nbsp; move past 5 hydroelectric generating stations when migrating seaward. As such, the research also contributes to the freshwater productivity science and management programs.&nbsp;The assessment program team on the Gaspereau River, also trials assessment methods that are used on other rivers, and is used by Fisheries Management as an example successful science-based management. As a result of fisheries management actions and improvements to fish passage, the spawning escapement has increased from roughly 80-120 thousand fish in the late 1990's, to over 1 million fish in each of the last three years. The program utilizes students at Acadia University for the field component, and has resulted to two Honours and one Masters thesis in the last 4 years.

This issue has led to\r\nseveral closures of aquaculture sites in Nova Scotia over the last few years with severe\r\nfinancial consequences to sea farmers (P. Darnell personal communication).\r\nHere, we have selected a site at Indian Point, which has seen an increase in\r\nHABs in recent years, to study the environmental factors that can lead to the\r\ndevelopment of high abundance of harmful algae species such as the diatoms <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> spp. (responsible for\r\namnesic shellfish poisoning, ASP), the dinoflagellate <em>Alexandrium catenella</em> spp. (responsible for paralytic shellfish\r\npoisoning, PSP) and the dinoflagellates <em>Dinophysis</em>\r\nand <em>Prorocentrum</em> spp. (responsible\r\nfor Diarrhoeic Shellfish Poisoning, DSP). Recently,\r\nP. Darnell, a scallop farmer with leases at Indian Point, contacted colleagues\r\nat the Bedford Institute of Oceanography to inquire about providing information\r\non phytoplankton at his site and discuss the issue of HABs, and in particular\r\nhigh level of DSP recorded by CFIA in mussels throughout the summer. The study of HABs, and their\r\nimpact on aquaculture, has also regained new interest at DFO with the creation\r\nof a national working group on Harmful Algal Bloom and a CSAS process that is\r\nunder progress. There is an evident need to understand the mechanisms and\r\nmonitor the occurrence of HABs, and in particular for aquaculture applications such\r\nthat farmers can anticipate and mitigate the impact of HABs. For the duration\r\nof the project (2 years), we will deploy instrumentation and collect water\r\nsamples to obtain information on the oceanographic conditions and identify the\r\nabundance of the main phytoplankton species, including the harmful ones at the\r\nIndian Point site. Simultaneously, we will acquire satellite observation of\r\nocean colour to retrieve information on sea-surface temperature, water clarity\r\nand chlorophyll-a concentration over, not only the aquaculture site, but the\r\nentire Bay and offshore environment. This will provide the opportunity to study\r\nthe spatial distribution of the oceanographic properties and extrapolate the\r\nfinding at Indian Point site to other sites where aquaculture is present. Satellite\r\nocean colour data have been used in the Bay of Fundy to develop a warning\r\nsystem for the occurrence of <em>Alexandrium\r\nFundyense</em> spp. (Devred et al. 2018). We will extend the time series of\r\nsatellite observation in the past to match the measurements made by the CFIA\r\nand other time series of oceanographic data collected at the Indian Point and the\r\nneighbourhood site of Saddle Island. The goal is to create a large database of\r\nsatellite observations concomitant to <em>in\r\nsitu</em> measurements that will help characterise the factors that lead to\r\npredominance of Harmful Algal species in the waters.</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe project leverage on research that has\r\nbeen conducted at the site over many years since Dalhousie University and DFO\r\nhave collected water samples at this site for many years.

In southern Newfoundland, the presence of first-generation hybrids (i.e. F1) has followed escape events in 2013 and 2015. Although evidence suggests decreased survival of hybrids in freshwater, observed increases in the number of backcross wild individuals supports the hypothesis that a proportion of these F1s (i.e., males) are maturing precocially and successfully reproducing. As such, introgression between wild populations and domestic lines is likely occurring with the potential for significant alteration of wild salmon life history traits (e.g., age at maturity) in the region. However, the ultimate impact of introgression between wild and domestic Atlantic Salmon remains difficult to resolve or predict.

Changing marine habitats affect species\r\nand ecosystem functions with direct consequences to food security of Indigenous\r\nPeople that rely upon higher trophic levels such as marine mammals and\r\nanadromous fishes. Multi-year datasets gathered through the BREA-MFP (2012-2014)\r\nand CBS-MEA (2017-2018) programs have made substantial progress towards\r\nbuilding baselines and addressing spatial gaps in physical and ecological observations.\r\nThe period of integrated observations is not yet sufficient to draw conclusions\r\nabout the long-term effects of climate change on species, habitat usage, and/or\r\nthe Beaufort ecosystem as a whole. However, the BREA-MFP and CBS-MEA have\r\ndocumented substantial inter-annual variability in ecosystem-wide responses to\r\nphysical drivers, which underscores the critical need to continue observations\r\non an annual basis. This proposal supports a 2019 field season, providing a crucial\r\nthird consecutive year of sampling that follows a heavily ice-impacted year and\r\ncoincides with the beluga aerial survey and beluga tagging activities. Outcomes\r\ninclude assessment of climate-related drivers on marine habitats relevant to\r\nkey species and ecosystem processes. Field observations are partnered with\r\nexperimental and modelling tools to help explain observed ecosystem variability\r\nand potential climate-driven changes in the future.

Accurate marine forecasts of surface currents are needed, particularly in rapidly changing severe storms, nor'easters, extratropical hurricanes, meteorological bombs, etc. in order to be able to efficiently respond to emergencies in Canadian waters, including littoral or nearshore areas, such as the search and rescue\r\noperations, marine transport, coastal fisheries, recreational boating, and oil-spill events.&nbsp; Marine forecast models are needed. Direct observations are not available to provide details of the\r\nspatial and temporal distributions of environmental factors that drive the surface currents. Therefore, we propose to advance the state-of-the-art for the numerical models of these ocean regions. Present models cannot forecast well waves and surface currents in severe rapidly changing storms. The related environmental factors include the detailed interplay of surface waves and ocean currents, affecting the upper ocean and near-surface ocean physical properties. Under these storm conditions, surface current simulations and forecasts from the numerical model simulations often have biases and lack accuracy if they ignore the impacts of surface waves, which can generate processes like wave breaking, Stokes drift and\r\nLangmuir turbulence, particularly under rapidly changing severe conditions.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Stokes drift refers to the periodic, orbital motions of progressive surface gravity waves induce a net drift in the direction of wave propagation. Formally, this drift motion is the di\ufb00erence between the phase-averaged Eulerian velocity and the mean Lagrangian motion of a particle in the wave \ufb01eld. Moreover, the Coriolis force acting on surface wave velocities leads to an additional force referred to as the Stokes-Coriolis force, which modi\ufb01es the mean current pro\ufb01le and alters the distribution of momentum in the upper ocean (i.e., the Ekman pro\ufb01le) over both the open ocean and the coastal inner shelf.&nbsp; The interaction between surface waves and ocean circulation incorporates the Vortex Force mechanism which is important in inner shelf and nearshore studies.&nbsp; The parameterization of Langmiur Turbulence in a turbulent mixing parameterization model, the application of the Stokes-Coriolis force, or the inclusion of the vortex force in the momentum equations, all require a representation of the Stokes drift velocity or its vertical shear.

Most of Canada's MPAs have the goal to protect marine biodiversity rather than any one particular habitat or species, making comprehensive monitoring of biogenic habitat, fish, invertebrates, cetaceans, and marine birds a priority. In order to monitor the specific conservation objectives of MPAs, we currently require ecosystem trawl and other annual survey data, opportunistic whale and marine bird sightings, industry support to observe and monitor large pelagic fishes, and advanced camera/video systems to observe deep sea corals and sponges. Further, some of these sampling methods can be invasive or destructive to benthic habitat within the very MPAs that are supposed to protect them, and as such, alternative monitoring strategies are needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Traditional biodiversity monitoring methods are unable to meet current organizational needs for timely, high resolution, broad spatial scale biological data to assist effective management decision-making in the face of accelerated environmental change and competing demands for resources. Environmental (e)DNA metabarcoding is a method that captures DNA molecules suspended in water to be sequenced, revealing species that are currently in the vicinity of the sample and are shedding DNA. Sequencing eDNA captured from small volumes (~1 L) of water yields millions of DNA sequences that can be compared to a reference library and rapidly determine which species are present in an area, and their relative abundance. eDNA metabarcoding has been shown to be comparable to other traditional sampling techniques, including SCUBA surveys, camera surveys, and trawling.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the relative simplicity of eDNA as a potential monitoring tool, there is still a lack of information on the spatial scale of eDNA sampling required to conduct comprehensive biodiversity surveys within a large MPA, the temporal scale at which the eDNA signal fluctuates in a given area (i.e., daily, monthly, ...?), and how eDNA moves and sinks or is resuspended by ocean currents. While we are unable to address every issue with the so-called \"ecology of eDNA\", we aim to investigate the spatial and temporal scale at which eDNA must be sampled to provide reliable results, as well as the effects of local environmental variables (water temperature, pH, salinity) on the correlation of eDNA results with the seining/trawl catch.&nbsp;</p><p>Our project will develop a standardized protocol and bioinformatics pipeline for eDNA metabarcoding and evaluate its use for measuring presence and relative abundance (specifically for select marine fishes) and general biodiversity in the marine environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Our broad overall <b>project goals</b> are to: </p><p>     (1) develop and implement nationally a standardized eDNA metabarcoding approach for monitoring marine biodiversity in Marine Protected Areas in Canada, including bioinformatics pipeline which can complement existing surveys;</p><p>     (2) field test the approach at various spatial and temporal scales in three oceans to improve our understanding of if, and how, it can meet the needs of MPA managers and other end-users; and</p><p>(3) contribute tissue samples towards an eDNA reference library that is necessary to identify species contained within eDNA samples.

Since 2016, Canada has endeavored on an ambitious expansion of MPAs, moving from <1% (55,000 km2) in 2016 to 10% (~570,000 km2) by 2020.\r\nAddressing these commitments, including measuring MPA network effectiveness, will require intensive ocean monitoring at unprecedented scales. Traditional marine survey methods rely on direct sampling and are often spatially restricted, taxon-specific, costly, difficult to calibrate, and in some cases destructive; thus are limited in their ability to capture large spatial and temporal complexity in marine systems. These limitations, and DFO\u2019s mandate to monitor the expanding Canadian MPA network, as well as other biodiversity conservation initiatives, necessitate innovative approaches to measuring marine diversity.\r\nHere, we propose to evaluate an indirect, synoptic, and cost-efficient eDNA metabarcoding approach as a potential tool for marine biodiversity monitoring, with specific applications to the Canadian MPA network and other initiatives (e.g., OPP). We will develop a nationally-standardized eDNA metabarcoding protocol that will be tested in three of Canada\u2019s ocean systems.

This PAM package consists of a\r\nTurbulent Research-OEM PORPOISE acoustic recorder hosted in a SeaExplorer payload section that\r\ncontains the payload electronics and the altimeter, which can be easily swapped\r\ninto the DFO SeaExplorer. Note that this is an\r\narchival PAM recorder, meaning that it collects and stores acoustic data, which\r\nmust then be downloaded upon retrieval of the Glider \u2013 it does not have\r\nreal-time acoustic detection capabilities. This system was successfully tested for use in recording baleen whale calls off Nova Scotia by DFO staff in 2019-2020.&nbsp;The\r\noverarching goal of this project moving forward is to increase our understanding of when and\r\nwhere NARW occur in eastern Canadian waters through collection of acoustic data\r\nusing a SeaExplorer glider equipped an archival PAM payload. Data collected will also contribute information on the\r\noccurrence of other baleen and toothed whale species within the region and thus\r\nthe proposed work also supports our broader cetacean monitoring program.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Project objectives:&nbsp;</b>The objective of\r\nthis specific proposed project is to conduct 1-2 three-week deployments using a\r\nSeaExplorer Glider equipped with our Alseamar PAM package in the spring, summer\r\nor fall period of 2020. The general areas of interest for deployments is the\r\nScotian Shelf and/or Gulf of Maine. Some of the potential areas of interest for\r\nNARW monitoring include Roseway Basin (identified Critical Habitat of NARW and an\r\narea of monitoring interest with potential implications for fisheries\r\nmanagement), Emerald Basin (another area that appears to be somewhat regularly used\r\nby NARW in the past), and Jordan Basin (an area that may be important to NARW \u2013\r\ndata has recently been collected from this area using a bottom-mounted recorder\r\nand will be analyzed for the presence of NARW calls over the winter-spring\r\nperiod). The general timeframe of interest is the spring, summer and fall of\r\n2020. NARW have been sighted as early as May in the Gulf of St. Lawrence area\r\nand acoustically detected as early as April. Visual and acoustic detections\r\npersist in the Gulf until December and beyond. The exact routes that NARW take\r\nto the Gulf and the timing of their movements on the Scotian Shelf remain a\r\nknowledge gap. Any data collected from the spring thru fall period in these\r\nareas may contribute additional data on the NARW occurrence and movement\r\npatterns. We are flexible in exact deployment locations and dates, and would\r\nwork with the BIO glider team to ensure that any deployments being planned\r\noccur within an area and over a time period that does not pose significant\r\nrisks to the glider or for accurate navigation of the glider.&nbsp;</p><p><b></b></p>", "priorities": "<ul><li>Conduct one or two 3-week deployments in the Scotian Shelf and/or Gulf of Maine area</li></ul>", "deliverables": "<ul><li>A summary report of describing deployments conducted including analysis results</li></ul>", "data_collection": "<p>Acoustic data</p><div><br /></div>", "data_sharing": "<p>None</p>", "data_storage": "<p>Will store data collected using data protocols developed by our team</p>", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "<p>None</p>", "sectional_dm_needs": "<p>None</p>", "vehicle_needs": "<p>None</p>", "it_needs": "", "chemical_needs": "<p>None</p>", "ship_needs": "<p>To be determined (based on deployment location)</p>", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": 10019, "allotment_code": 3, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": false, "meeting_notes": "Editing budget.", "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-02-06T19:11:26.501-04:00", "last_modified_by": 933, "programs": [36], "tags": [1], "existing_project_codes": [1112]}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 878, "fields": {"year": 2021, "section": 24, "project_title": "Advice:  revise draft CSAS Documents on CEPA DAS and siting", "activity_type": 1, "functional_group": 17, "default_funding_source": 2, "is_national": false, "status": 2, "is_competitive": false, "is_approved": null, "start_date": "2019-04-01T00:00:00-03:00", "end_date": "2021-03-31T00:00:00-03:00", "description": "<p>revise CSAS Res Docs and CSAS SAR on aquaculture siting&nbsp;</p>", "priorities": "", "deliverables": "<p>revised documents</p>", "data_collection": "", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": null, "allotment_code": null, "feedback": "", "submitted": true, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": true, "meeting_notes": "", "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-04-02T17:21:48.026-03:00", "last_modified_by": 447, "programs": [8], "tags": [29], "existing_project_codes": []}}, {"model": "projects.project", "pk": 880, "fields": {"year": 2021, "section": 31, "project_title": "National CSAS Coordination System", "activity_type": 4, "functional_group": 22, "default_funding_source": 1, "is_national": true, "status": 1, "is_competitive": false, "is_approved": false, "start_date": "2020-04-01T00:00:00-03:00", "end_date": "2021-03-31T00:00:00-03:00", "description": "<p>The goal of this project is to develop a national CSAS tracking system within the DM Apps framework.</p><div>The existing CSAS system is based on MS Access and suffers from a variety of functional and usability issues.</div><div><br />Some preliminary analysis has already been undertaken nationally, and the goals will be to continue those discussions and deliver a modernized system to support coordinators and users.</div>", "priorities": "<p>1.

RCM consists of three C-band synthetic aperture\r\nradars (SARs) which occupy the same orbit plane (thereby allowing fast revisit times). The primary objective of RCM is to support\r\nthe operational requirements of Canadian Government Departments such as DFO and ECCC, for maritime\r\nsurveillance, ecosystem monitoring and&nbsp;disaster management. Compared to\r\nprevious radar satellites, the innovative improvements that have been made for RCM include daily\r\ncoverage (and more, up to 4x times daily in polar regions), fast revisit times, and observations of the ocean surface using the unique compact polarimetry imaging mode, as implemented in the RCM satellites. These\r\nnew features ensure that RCM can support activities such as mapping of ocean surface currents, detection, classification and monitoring of sea ice and icebergs, detection and monitoring of oil spills and oil pollution, and intense storms impacting the ocean surface, such as polar lows and extra-tropical hurricanes in oceans bordering Canada. Thus, RCM provides unique new opportunities for marine observation, climate change research and integrated ocean\r\nand coastal zone management.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>1: </b><b>Ocean\r\nsurface current mapping</b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Background:</b> RCM wide swath imaging mode provides gridded products of\r\nDoppler centroid values, with spatial resolution of 2 km, which offers a good\r\nopportunity to retrieve ocean surface current velocities. The Doppler shift\r\nresults from the combined action of near surface wind on shorter waves, longer\r\nwave motion, wave breaking and surface currents. The line-of-sight velocity of the moving ocean surface can be estimated from the Doppler frequency shift.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Approach:</b> According to the RCM payload data, such as satellite orbit\r\nand attitude, the Doppler centroid values are firstly accurately estimated. Then, a\r\ntwo dimensional Doppler radar imaging model (DopRIM) is used to estimate the predicted Doppler shift, with given wind, current and sea surface temperature.\r\nBy comparing the observed and predicted Doppler shift and removing the Doppler\r\nsignatures from wind and waves (also observed by the SAR), the high-resolution radial ocean surface\r\ncurrent components can be obtained.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Validation:</b> The retrieved ocean surface current velocities will be\r\nvalidated using coincident in situ measurements from drifting surface buoys, ADCP data, and altimeter-derived surface geostrophic currents.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Outcome:</b> RCM ocean surface current mapping products have the potential to be\r\nassimilated into ocean circulation models to further improve the accuracy of the model forecasts for surface currents.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>2: </b><b>Sea\r\nice classification and ice motion monitoring</b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Background: </b>The ability to\r\nclassify Arctic Ocean sea ice types and to plan safe navigational routes through\r\nsea ice infested waters is an area of great interest for Government Departments such as CIS and DFO.The compact polarimetric (CP) SAR\r\nconfiguration is the special imaging mode of the RCM, which enables the use of CP SAR\r\ndata in wide swath imagery mode. RCM satellites transmit a right-circular\r\npolarization and receive two mutually coherent orthogonal (horizontal and vertical)\r\nlinear polarizations (RH and RV). The main advantage of such a SAR system is that it can provide increased radar target information, in comparison to standard\r\ndual-pol SAR systems, while covering much greater spatial swaths compared to the much smaller spatial swaths of fully\r\npolarimetric SAR systems. Operational sea ice monitoring and classification\r\nusually relies on SAR data from single- or dual-polarized beam modes, such as\r\nthe ScanSAR mode of RADARSAT-2. However, the imagery from such modes only provides\r\npartial information about the radar target, which can affect the accuracy of the resulting sea ice classification.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Approach: </b>Histograms\r\nof first-year ice (FYI) and multi-year ice (MYI) are first analyzed and\r\nvisually interpreted. Then, the separation of two ice types is\r\nquantified using the a standard methodology, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distance. Also, the correlation\r\nbetween the CP parameters is analyzed by estimating the so-called Spearman correlation\r\ncoefficient values between all possible CP parameter combinations to detect\r\npossible information redundancy. Finally, sea ice classification using a\r\ntrained Random Forest (RF) classifier is then performed on identified effective\r\nCP parameters of the RCM data. Therefore, based on the Maximum Cross-Correlation\r\n(MCC) technique, we aim to use multi-temporal RCM imagery to detect and track the sea\r\nice motion.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Validation: </b>Sea ice\r\nclassification and motion detection results will be compared with data from\r\nice charts and optical satellite observations.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Outcome:\r\n</b>Satellite-basedsea ice classification and motion monitoring\r\nare very important activities for ship navigation in Arctic ocean waters and for better\r\nunderstanding of Arctic and global climate change.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>3: </b><b>Oil\r\nspill detection in the open water and sea ice</b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Background: </b>There are oil platforms located off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2018, an\r\noil spill off the coast of Newfoundland caused an estimated 250,000 litres of\r\ncrude oil to leak into the ocean, which seriously affected the ecosystem. Therefore,\r\nit is very important to detect and monitor oil spills using satellite remote sensing observations. RCM\r\nhas a short revisit period and wide spatial swath coverage, which enables the monitoring of oil\r\npollution day and night, in all weather conditions.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Approach: W</b>e\r\naim to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to discriminate oil\r\nspill regions from the clean ocean surface and other lookalike features such as low wind effects on the ocean surface and\r\nbiogenetic slicks. A couple of SAR polarimetric feature parameters associated with\r\ndark patches can be used to train the CNN model. The areas of oil-covered water are also\r\nestimated. CP SAR data are used to validate the performance of model\r\nclassifier.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Validation:</b> Oil spill\r\ndetection results are examined and validated by using airborne or spaceborne optical satellite\r\nobservations.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>4: </b><b>Polar\r\ncyclone monitoring</b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Background:</b> Polar lows are small, but very intense maritime cyclones that develop at high\r\nlatitudes in waters off Canada, poleward from the main atmospheric baroclinic zone. Their horizontal scale ranges\r\nfrom 200 to 800 km and their lifecycle is short, often less 48 hours. As a result of\r\nthese characteristics, they are often unresolved by the more widely spaced synoptic\r\nobserving network. These characteristics often result in their development being missed, or\r\ntheir intensity being under-predicted by operational numerical weather\r\npredictions. But nevertheless, they are a significant maritime hazard, as a\r\nresult of high winds, often gale force or above, and heavy seas.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Approach: </b>We aim to develop an approach to detect and track polar lows based on the SAR satellite active microwave data from RADARSAT-2 and RCM, as well as&nbsp;passive microwave observations from other satellites. In this approach, we first derive the atmospheric total water vapor content fields from passive microwave radiometer data, such as from AMSR-E. Then, the vortex\r\nstructures are detected by a visual analysis in these fields and the polar lows are\r\nidentified. Finally, RCM SAR data are used to derive the invaluable information\r\nabout the high spatial resolution near-surface wind fields, the precise locations, and the structure of the atmospheric fronts and polar low centers. Taken all together, this information will provide the most complete knowledge available about a mesoscale low, such as may occur in the Labrador Sea or over the Grand Banks; including the highest temporal\r\nresolution and estimation of all available parameters.</p>", "priorities": "<p>Priorities include development of AI-based techniques for retrieval of observations from SAR (synthetic aperture radar) observations of ocean surface features, like identification of oil spill events, and the ocean features and currents that constitute the response to intense atmospheric forcing, such as from polar lows, or nor'easters.&nbsp;</p><div><br /></div>", "deliverables": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Year 1:</b>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Present convolutional neural network models for:&nbsp; (a) Detection of oil spill events in Canadian waters, for example, the southern Labrador Sea and Grand Banks where hydrocarbon products are presently being extracted.

Thus,\r\nwe will calculate ocean climate\r\nchange using a state-of-the-art ice-ocean model, following DFO and ECCC, namely NEMO ocean model, to estimate key\r\nvariables; ocean temperature, mixed layer depths, light, wind stress, currents,\r\nmixing mechanisms and pathways, lengths of melt/freeze periods, and ice. The Arctic Ocean has stable, shallow stratification by salinity, giving low availability of nutrients in the mixed layer. Primary production is therefore disproportionately influenced by physical factors (light and vertical mixing),\r\nnot by ecosystem dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\">To validate the physical models we make comparisons with field observations and international\r\ncollaboration, to improve our model, namely measurements of chemical tracers, like 129I, 136U,\r\ndischarged from European&nbsp;nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, gas ventilation tracers such as CFCs and SF6,\r\nand 134, 137Cs from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, by\r\napplying new transit time distribution (TTD) models.&nbsp;We also\r\nconsider Arctic freshwater content (FWC), in the Beaufort Sea,\r\nDavis Strait, etc. Thus, we will simulate the key\r\ndriving factors for ecosystem models; sea-ice, salinity, temperature, mixed\r\nlayer depth, wind stress, etc., from these models, and estimate projections for\r\n1970~2100, to investigate:\r\n(a) climate change\r\nscenarios based on multiple state-of-the-art GCMs, (b) the relative\r\nimportance of IPCC emissions scenarios for Arctic projections, (c)\r\ncharacteristics of the key driving factors for\r\necosystem-relevant parameters under different climate change scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Arctic has been predicted to have ice-free summers by the\r\nmiddle of twenty-first century. For example, under the IPCC climate change\r\nscenarios (RCP8.5), there is more than 10% decrease per decade in ice volume,\r\nwith the Arctic Ocean becoming largely ice-free in the summers by about ~ 2060.\r\nMoreover, a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean is expected to have significant\r\nclimatic consequences. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Loss of sea ice can enhance air-sea interactions and\r\naffect the ocean circulation in the Arctic Ocean. Due to the increased ice\r\nmelting and Ekman transport, there is an increasing trend in fresh water\r\ncontent (FWC) and sea surface height (SSH) in the Beaufort Sea. The increase is\r\nabout 2 m for the FWC and 6 cm for the SSH from 1979 to 2070. In terms of the Atlantic\r\nwater layer (AWL) in the central Arctic Ocean, its temperature tends to\r\ndecrease from 0.36<sup>o</sup>C in the 2010s to 0.26<sup>o</sup>C in the 2060s.\r\nIn the vertical, the warm Atlantic water core slightly expands before the\r\n2030s, significantly shrinks after the 2050s, and essentially disappears by\r\n2070-2100, in the southern Beaufort Sea.</p></div><div>But these estimates have limitations. Often they are based on a one-member\r\nsimulations, and uncertainty can present a key challenge for the future\r\nclimate projections. The dominant source of uncertainty includes internal model variability and model variability among different global climate models. Here, we propose to assess the uncertainty\r\nusing the downscaling system for the Arctic, by creating ensemble of downscaled simulations.

1996; Finstad et al. 2000; Wagner et al. 2004; Fast et al. 2006); the others being related to fish health and wild farmed interactions.&nbsp; All of this leads to the development of social licence. A better understanding of the larval stages of this parasite, particularly their distribution and potential mechanisms to remain on site, will allow farmers to develop mitigation measures to limit the success of these larvae and reduce future the severity and/or frequency of future sea lice infestations. Better management of these parasites will increase the comfort level of resource managers and the general public.</li></ul>I<b>ncrease collaborative research between the department and industry:</b><br /><ul><li>This project will involve close collaboration between industry and the department in regards to site access for sampling, on-site treatments, sea lice levels and fish health, as well as regular face-to-face meetings with industry management to communicate results and ongoing research.&nbsp;</li></ul><b>Facilitate the process of technology transfer and knowledge mobilization:</b><br /><ul><li>Now that we know where the infective larvae are located, developing a near real time monitoring system that can be used by industry and other environmental managers will be invaluable to their management plans and help to manage sea lice infestations on a broader regional scale.&nbsp;</li></ul><b>Increase scientific capacity of the Canadian aquaculture industry for essential aquaculture research and development:</b><br /><ul><li>Currently, DFO is a world-leader in sea lice larval research which positions the Department well to impact the success and development of the Canadian aquaculture industry on a global scale.

Sea lice are the number one issue affecting the health of farmed Atlantic salmon. Proper health management of this parasite requires a full and complete understanding of its life cycle in order to develop appropriate and sustainable treatments and make management decisions with regard to site selection. Recent research (ACRDP 17-M-01 early life history sea lice project) has revealed that infective sea lice larval densities are concentrated near the shoreline by physical retention processes and are available to be transported back onto the farms to perpetuate the infestation cycle. They are also potentially able to be transported up and down the coastline by longshore currents influencing other farms along the way. Understanding this infection cycle will allow for the possibility to monitor areas in order to evaluate practices and also identify problematic farms in areas and intervene if necessary. This will have a direct impact on the health of the fish at the farms and indirectly on wild salmon in the region.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Priorities:</b></div><div><b>Pest and Pathogen Management for Cultured Stocks \u2013 Mitigation of Pest and Pathogen Impacts, Management and Control of Pests and Pathogens:</b></div><div><ul><li>This research will help lead to a better understanding of the biology and distribution of the early life history (larval) stages of sea lice on salmon farms in New Brunswick.

The white shark research program was initiated and designed to&nbsp;describe habitat used by white shark at the northernmost edge of the species' range as compared to elsewhere in the North Atlantic in order to evaluate critical habitat. There are two components to this program: a tagging project and an acoustic montioring project, both of which have been ongoing since 2017/2018. All of this work is being done in collaboration with the Massachusetts&nbsp;Division of Marine Fish and the White Shark Conservancy, who have generously agreed to share their data provided our program is methodologically similar. This means that activities in Canada are supported by a $650K USD per year research program in Cape Cod, which combines satellite tagging, acoustic tagging and an extensive acoustic monitoring array along the Eastern Seaboard.</p><p>This project describes the acoustic monitoring component of the research program. The focus is on White Shark, but the monitoring network has the potential to detect other SAR including Porbeagle Shark, Atlantic Salmon and Striped Bass.</p><p>Methods: Acoustic receivers (n ~ 35) will be deployed at near-shore locations (3-5 sites) from the DFO vessel \u2018Nolan\u2019 and at 2 offshore sites from Industry vessels in the spring of 2020. These will remain in place until late fall, with retrieval starting in October. Due to challenges associated with retrieval, this step requires contracting a commercial vessel with a winch and side-scan sonar. Any detections will be compared against known white shark tag numbers to determine time spent in an area as well as movement along the coast. Note that the total number of receivers to be deployed is reduced from 2019/2020 due to equipment losses during hurricane Dorion.&nbsp;</p>", "priorities": "<p>SARA justification: Implementation of the Draft Recovery Strategy for White Shark.

Yet, many forage fish\r\nstocks are considered at or below the lower reference point (e.g., 4XVW Herring,\r\nCSAS 2018/037; Gulf herring, CSAS 2018/029; Quebec herring, CSAS 2017/027; Newfoundland\r\nHerring, CSAS 2017/028, CSAS 2018/036), suggesting that science advice should\r\nbe improved to better manage these stocks. Therefore, we need to understand\r\nwhat ecological (and social-economic) processes drive forage fishes population\r\ndynamics and distributions. However, we first require the ability to accurately\r\nmonitor population size and distribution of forage fishes over a long\r\ntime-series and large spatial scales. Currently, many assessments of forage\r\nfishes rely upon small-scale or fishery dependent data and likely have observational\r\nbias. &nbsp;Herein, we suggest an unbiased\r\nacoustic-based methodology (multi-frequency wideband echosounders and acoustic\r\ntarget classification) that will\r\nbe cost-effective and efficient compared to traditional sampling and could create\r\nlarge-scale abundance indices of forage fishes as well as groundfish stocks in Bay of\r\nFundy and Scotian Shelf.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This project will also support ground-truthing of the existing herring acoustic surveys in Maritime Region.&nbsp;Since\r\n1999 The herring industry conducts acoustic surveys on the Scots Bay and German\r\nBank spawning grounds &nbsp;to estimate herring\r\nspawning stock biomass which is used as the primary indicator of the stock\r\nstatus. These surveys have a high temporal and spatial coverage. Generally 6 to\r\n8 surveys are conducted on each ground in each year during late Spring to early\r\nFall, because herring are spawn and then leave, resulting in turnover on the\r\nspawning ground.&nbsp;The\r\nacoustic surveys are conducted concurrently by 6 to 9 industry vessels,\r\nproviding high spatial resolution.&nbsp;<font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\">However, concerns were raised by industry and\r\nDFO science over the scrutiny of the acoustic data.

We request that a BI-02 be hired to help complete project deliverables. Term BI-02 will be hired within 6 months of first year of work. Term will support data processing and methodology development.\r\n\r\nMethodology:  \r\n\r\nCalibration and deployment (Year 1,2&3): Calibration of an EK80 echosounder system equipped with ES38-7, 70-7C, 120-7C, 200-7C transducers) will occur using a small DFO vessel (CCGS Salar) at St. Andrews Biological Station. Following calibrations, EK80 echosounder systems will record wideband multi-frequency acoustic data to determine whether software is operating adequately. With permission, wideband multi-frequency acoustic data of an active herring weir will be recorded and compared to length-sampled data to provide validation known empirical values of herring single-target acoustic backscatter. It should be noted that calibration of the EK80 echosounder system deployed on the new DFO research vessel will also be required prior to the annual ecosystem survey of Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf.\r\n\r\nAcoustic and biological sampling (year 1): Acoustic sampling will be collected aboard the CCGS Viola Davidson, as well as chartered fishing vessels to build a library of acoustic backscatter data using a wideband multi-frequency echosounder system. Biological sampling will occur concurrently using a bottom or pelagic-trawl to sample fish. For as many sets as possible, the net will be towed for a period of 3 to 5 minutes, catch will then be identified to lowest practical taxonomic level, weighed, and length measurements will be taken for at least 200 individuals for each fish species. To determine the accuracy of acoustic target classification, targeted and randomized sampling will be conducted to capture catch composed of a single species (i.e.,<90% of the catch) and data composed of mix of species, respectively.\r\n\r\nAcoustic target identification and validation (Year 1, 2): Echoview software will be used to estimate acoustic backscatter from pelagic and demersal fish species. Acoustic target identification of fish species will occur using the collected wideband multi-frequency acoustic data, by modifying existing methodology of acoustic target identification for North Atlantic marine fishes (Korneliussen 2018). Species biomass and composition will be estimated directly from acoustic data and will be compared to and validated using concurrently sampled biological data. Preliminary research indicates that we will be able to provide acoustic target identification for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), mackerel (Scomber scumbus), dogfish (Squalus acanthias), redfish (Sebastes spp.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), pollock (Pollochias virens), and silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis).\r\n\r\nAcoustic survey program and comparison to the summer ecosystem survey (Year 2, 3): Chartered vessel(s) will be used to perform a systematic acoustic survey of Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf during July-August for two years. Multiple chartered vessels could be used to perform different legs of the acoustic survey and biological sampling will not be conducted. Chartered vessels must have the ability to deploy an EK80 echosounder system operated by an acoustician. Chartered vessels will require minor modifications to a davit to deploy a pole-mount or be equipped with a wing-stabilizer to deploy a clamped-body or have the ability to deploy a towed-body from a cable wire.  \r\n\r\nThe systematic acoustic survey will be conducted concurrently to the summer ecosystem survey of Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf. The CCGS Jaques Cariter is scheduled to be deployed in 2020 will be equipped with a EK80 echosounder system operating with multiple frequencies. As in previous ecosystem surveys performed by the CCGS Alfred Needler or CCGS Teleost, acoustic data will be continuously recorded and be used as means to estimate acoustic-based indices of abundance of fishes. However, unlike previous surveys, the use of wideband multi-frequency EK80 echosounder system on the new research vessel would allow for direct identification of fish species using acoustic target classification and will likely be more accurate than the existing acoustic-based indices of abundance (i.e., the approach used to estimate and index for western component pollock abundance; Debertin unpublished). Two years of sampling will be required to avoid potential survey year effects (i.e., unexplained observation error effects) and will be used to determine whether the randomized acoustic transects from the summer ecosystem survey will be sufficient to provide an accurate acoustic-based index for forage fishes. \r\n\r\nWorkplan: \r\n\r\nThis research will require the hiring of a 3-year term BI-02 biologist.

Further and accurate indices of herring abundance would be critical to improve science advice of the stock. Extensive funding and research collaborative agreements have been devoted to the development of an acoustic-based index of western component (4X5Z) pollock. Previous research has resulted in an acoustic-based index for pollock, cod, haddock, redfish, dogfish and herring, but relies on species composition data from the summer ecosystem survey (Debertin, unpublished). The methodology used by Debertin (unpublished) could potentially be misleading for forage fishes due to biased bottom-trawl sampling of pelagic species.

The most\r\nsignificant of these factors (or unknowns) include the following;</p><p>&nbsp; -&nbsp; reproductive periodicity &amp; spawning seasonality\r\n(i.e., how many times per year and during what months do AMP spawn larvae into\r\nthe water column);</p>\r\n\r\n&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;planktonic larval duration (PLD) (i.e., how much\r\ntime larvae spend in the water column and ultimately how far and where they\r\ndisperse);\r\n\r\n&nbsp; -&nbsp; larval behaviour during planktonic development\r\n(i.e., do larvae act as passive particles during planktonic development or do\r\nthey exhibit behaviour, such as aggregating at specific depths or near physical\r\nfeature, such as density discontinuities; e.g., pycnoclines).\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;While inherent\r\nvariability in model parameters is a common limitation in modelling\r\napplications, constraining this variability through sensitivity analyses (being\r\nproposed here) can help to constrain prediction error and better define and understand\r\necological range limits on predictions. Given the lack of detailed information\r\non AMP life-history characteristics listed above and limitations to quantify\r\nthese directly (i.e., in situ or in the laboratory due to limited and\r\nthreatened population status), leaves sensitivity analyses as our preferred\r\napproach. In fact, best-modelling-practices assume and expect an assessment of model\r\nsensitivity to help characterize and quantify model performance and limitations.\r\nFor example, benthic invertebrate bivalves that have been studied most\r\nextensively in this region (Atlantic sea scallop, <em>Placopecten magellanicus</em>) have an estimated planktonic larval duration\r\nof 4 to 8 wks. depending on ambient conditions (e.g., temperature). Therefore,\r\nto describe the true dispersal potential of AMP, we could use this as a best\r\nestimate and simulate larval dispersal across a range of values (e.g., 6, 7, 8-wk\r\nPLDs) to assess effects of PLD on connectivity and source/sink dynamics.</p><p>This\r\napproach would be applied to all life-history factor listed above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work\r\nproposed here will not require any significant change or modification to the hydrodynamic\r\nFVCOM circulation model framework. This work has been completed as part of our\r\npreliminary larval dispersal / connectivity study (see above).

Many of the coastal\r\nwatersheds in the Maritimes Region do not have estimates of nutrient exports,\r\nothers are outdated or they lack a regional-scale perspective. This project\r\nwill address these knowledge gaps by compiling new information on nutrient\r\ninputs to the coastal zone across the Maritimes region. Watershed-specific\r\ninformation on human activities and land-use will be gathered from openly\r\naccessible government sources, and compiled into a data inventory.\r\nUsing this information, we will apply the Nitrogen Loading Model (NLM)\r\nframework&nbsp;to estimate the total annual input of nitrogen from\r\npoint and non-point sources.

In addition to the subsistence harvest, there is ongoing pressure by Greenland to reopen the commercial fishery, which had an annual average harvest exceeding 800 t in the 1980s. Denmark (on behalf of Greenland) claims that mixed stock fisheries in home waters, particularly at Labrador and Saint-Pierre &amp; Miquelon, also exploit stocks of low conservation status and at a combined harvest which exceeds the catch at West Greenland. Concerns about subsistence fisheries in Labrador have also been expressed by the US and NGO groups in North America as US origin stocks, which are all listed as endangered may be harvested in those fisheries as well as in Saint-Pierre &amp; Miquelon.  Previous genetic analysis using a regional microsatellite baseline revealed significant differences in the stock composition of these three fisheries (Bradbury et al., 2015; ICES, 2015; Bradbury et al., 2016a,b) and recent preliminary analysis indicates higher levels of trans-Atlantic migration than previously expected (ICES 2015).</p>", "priorities": "<p>The Aquatic Biotechnology Lab\u2019s role is to genotype 2000 samples using a 96 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) panel (SSASNPP02).</p>", "deliverables": "<ul><li>Extract DNA as applicable.</li><li>PicoGreen quantification of all extracted DNA samples.</li><li>SNP analysis samples by applying SSASNPP02 SNP panel to each sample</li><li>Determine the genotype error rate</li><li>Provide final data in a format suitable for STRUCTURE</li><li>Provide a report to accompany the final data</li></ul>", "data_collection": "<p>\t\t\t\tSingle Nucleotide Polymorphism genotypes (for example G:A)\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "data_sharing": "<p>\t\t\t\tSharing/dissemination of the data is the responsibility of the project lead.

The Partnership Program to map the Bay of\r\nFundy has developed habitat maps for Scallop throughout the majority of the\r\ncore Scallop habitat in the Bay of Fundy.&nbsp;\r\nA second collaboration is also nearing completion with Dalhousie\r\nUniversity in which a spatially explicit stock assessment model for one area in\r\nthe Bay of Fundy has been developed.&nbsp;\r\nThis model implicitly accounts for heterogeneity in scallop productivity\r\nacross the region. The results to date indicate that even without a detailed\r\nknowledge of the drivers of these productivity patterns, this model better\r\ncaptures the dynamics in this region and may lead to improved science advice\r\nfor this area. &nbsp;</p><p>These two projects have developed the data and the modelling\r\nframework required to develop a Spatially Explicit Habitat Based Assessment Model\r\n(SEHBAM) for the Bay of Fundy. To our knowledge SEHBAM would be the first model\r\nof its class globally.&nbsp; The model would\r\nincorporate geological, oceanographic, ecological, and fishery data into a\r\nspatial explicit assessment framework that is driven by a classic fisheries\r\nbiomass dynamics model. The development of SEHBAM would serve as the foundation\r\nto develop similar models in other areas (e.g. Georges Bank) and could be a\r\nframework for which other spatio-temporal stock assessment models could be\r\ndeveloped.&nbsp; Finally, this modelling\r\nframework would facilitate the development of a single lower reference point\r\n(LRP) for the majority of the Bay of Fundy as will be required for Bill C-68. &nbsp;</p><p>The current Bay of Fundy stock assessment is divided into 5\r\ndifferent areas and results in a very challenging workload for the Scallop and\r\nBenthic Habitat Unit. The development of SEHBAM will enable the majority of the\r\nBay of Fundy to be modelled in one model. While still providing assessment\r\nadvice for 5 separate areas in the Bay of Fundy it is hoped that efficiencies\r\ngained through having one model for the majority of the region may help to\r\nameliorate the unsustainable workload demands currently facing the Scallop\r\nUnit. </p><p>Through the collaboration with Dalhousie we have a trained\r\nHQP who developed the spatially explicit stock assessment model, is familiar\r\nwith the habitat work being undertaken in the Bay of Fundy, has obtained their\r\nDFO reliability status, and will be available in the fall of 2020 to undertake\r\nthis project. Utilizing this HQP while they are available would enable the\r\ndevelopment of SEHBAM framework over a two year period. Spatial stock\r\nassessment models have been identified as next generation methods (Punt 2019, Cadrin\r\n2020) and the development of SEHBAM would provide Maritimes region with a world-class\r\nassessment that integrates recent advances in bottom mapping, oceanographic\r\nmodelling, and statistical methodologies to provide quantitative\r\nenvironmentally conditioned science advice.</p>", "priorities": "<p>\t\t\t\tIn the current fiscal year this project will begin the integration of the recently developed Spatially Explicit Assessment Model (SEAM) developed for scallop in the Bay of Fundy with recently developed Habitat Maps in the Bay of Fundy.\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>", "deliverables": "<ul><li>Development of a Spatially Explicit Habitat Based Assessment Model (SEHBAM) for scallop in the Bay of Fundy</li><li>Primary publication(s)</li><li>DFO Research Document(s)</li></ul>", "data_collection": "", "data_sharing": "", "data_storage": "<p>Model outputs may be large and will be stored in locally maintained NAS storage system (with double redundant backup system in place).&nbsp; Due to volume of data alternative storage options are currently limited.</p>", "metadata_url": null, "regional_dm_needs": "", "sectional_dm_needs": "", "vehicle_needs": "", "it_needs": "<p>User will require Power desktop or laptop (for teleworking) due to the intensive nature of the statistical modelling required for this project.</p>", "chemical_needs": "", "ship_needs": "", "notes": "", "responsibility_center": null, "allotment_code": null, "feedback": "", "submitted": false, "approved": false, "recommended_for_funding": false, "meeting_notes": null, "is_hidden": false, "date_last_modified": "2020-05-11T08:15:21.106-03:00", "last_modified_by": 879, "programs": [], "tags": [21, 54, 70], "existing_project_codes": []}}]
