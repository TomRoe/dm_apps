+ River
  wheel code, across the time-series 6 locations have been used:
    Butters
    Kedgwick
    LittleMain (only one year 2003)
    Matapedia (only 3 years 2015-2017)
    Moses
   Upsalquitch
+ Year
  year of entry 	
+ Month	
  month of entry
+ Day
  day of entry	
+ Time.Start
  time at which sampling started in hh:mm	
+ Time.Released	
  time at which marked fish were release in hh:mm	
+ Species
  species code as used in oracle data base, i can provide you the list I have for confirmation	
+ First.Tag
  code of the first tag used for that sample 	
+ Last.Tag
  code of the last tag used for that sample
  only used if fih are entered in batch (Freq>1)
  if Freq == 1, it is left blank 
+ Status
  coding for the status of the samples being processes
    M: mortality
    MR: mortality recapture
    MS: mortality sampled 
    MZ: mortality research removal (fish euthanasied)
    R: released, unsampled
    RI: released, injury
    RL: released lost
    RR: released, recapture
    RRL: released, recapture, lost
    RS: released, sampled
    RT: released, tagged
    UST: ultra-sonic tagging
+ Origin
  A: adipose clipped (hatchery)
  W: wild	
+ Freq	
  number of individual fish sampled (can be >1 when fish are sampled in batch)
+ ForkLength
  fork length of the sample in mm	
+ Total.Length
  total length of the sample in mm
  certain species dont have a a forked caudal fin (lampreys, eels) so total length is used	
+ Weight
  weight of the sample in grams	
+ Sex
  sex of sample (mostly salmon samples)
    M: male
    F: female
    Mp: precocious male
    U: unknown 	
+ Smolt.Age
  age of smolt, should only be available for samples with species code = 1732
  but there are a few rainbow trouts that were also aged and are entered in this column	
+ Location.Tagged
  column for recaptured fish, indicated where the fish was tagged. 
  I haven't check for errors has in this column as I have a stript that checks for released tagged	
+ Date.Tagged
   column for recaptured fish, indicated when the fish was tagged. 
  I haven't check for errors has in this column as I have a stript that checks for released tagged
+ Scale ID Number
  scales samples are taken and put in an enveloppe. the scale ID corresponds to the ID on the enveloppe
+ tags removed	
  This was added by me to clean up the data frame, sometimes the Freq column did not match (Last.Tag - First.Tag)
  because some of the broken removed tags were not accounted for. 
  this column is just the list of tag briken/removed (as recorded in log sheets) separated by a space
+ Comments
  anything ranging from description of sample to edit of the perticular line of the dataframe
