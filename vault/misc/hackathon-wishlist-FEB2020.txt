- app access limitations

- vault admin can edit tables that users can't
   ---admin tables for instrument types and organizations (need CRUD structure)

- create an empty directory structure for image storage based on the database contents

- populate tables as much as possible using scripts that fetch and summarise images' EZIF information, GPX tracks, etc.

- how will new information be included once the initial data holdings are absorbed in the database?

- Outing Tables -- how to do date/time pickers? DecimalField
                -- how to do proper rounding to allow for quarter hour calculations?
                -- how to have foreignKey display another field from the other table (i.e. instead of Observation platform id, display the name of the aircraft)


Questions / Concerns
1) If this:

    "def __str__(self):
        return self.identifier_string"

    doesn't have a value in that column, it returns an error, so should this field be required to be set to not NULL?
    (ran into this problem with the outing table)
