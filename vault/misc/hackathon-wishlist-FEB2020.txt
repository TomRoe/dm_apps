- app access limitations

- vault admin can edit tables that users can't
   ---admin tables for instrument types and organizations (need CRUD structure)

- create an empty directory structure for image storage based on the database contents

- populate tables as much as possible using scripts that fetch and summarise images' EZIF information, GPX tracks, etc.

- how will new information be included once the initial data holdings are absorbed in the database?

- Outing Tables -- how to do date/time pickers? DecimalField
                -- how to do proper rounding to allow for quarter hour calculations?
                -- how to have foreignKey display another field from the other table (i.e. instead of Observation platform id, display the name of the aircraft)
                -- in outing_detail, if track is available add a map that shows what the track was?

- dashboard(s) for showing stats and information most requested by management

- reports section to export data to file

Questions / Concerns
1) If this:

    "def __str__(self):
        return self.identifier_string"

    doesn't have a value in that column, it returns an error, so should this field be required to be set to not NULL?
    (ran into this problem with the outing table)

2) When using many to many model -- why does selecting multiple items in a field create duplicate records? How to stop this? (See person list for example under Admin-only tables)
