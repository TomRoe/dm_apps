- app access limitations

- vault admin can edit tables that users can't

- create an empty directory structure for image storage based on the database contents

- populate tables as much as possible using scripts that fetch and summarise images' EZIF information, GPX tracks, etc.

- how will new information be included once the initial data holdings are absorbed in the database?
