Prevention is the most efficient and cost-effective method of dealing with aquatic invasive species, including managing the pathways that they travel along to enter and spread in our waters. In order for the Department to meet its mandate to try to prevent introduction, establishment and spread of AIS, there is a need for Science advice on a 'watchlist' of species which may be introduced into Maritimes Region. In particular, advice is requested on the following questions:\n-which new AIS are most likely to be introduced to the Maritimes region (in both freshwater and marine ecosystems) considering the presence of dispersal vectors and modes of introduction? \n-what are the expected impacts of these species if introduced and successfully established? ",
            "consequence_text": "Without this Science advice, the AIS National Core Program - Maritimes Region will be limited in its ability to effectively conduct proactive monitoring and rapid response to new AIS detections.
