The commitment to submit requests for the Science advice considered necessary for improving the management of the Atlantic sturgeon fishery was part of this recommendation. A request for CSAS advice was submitted for 2017/18,but has not move forward to date. It is anticipated that a listing decision will be published within the next 2 years so there is a need for the region to demonstrate progress towards more effective management of the fishery.  Additionally, erroneous food, social and ceremonial allocations to Aboriginal organizations, erroneous quota allocations in the commercial fishery and the loss of recreational access could result from the lack of Science advice.",

Maritimes Region has submitted a recommendation to not list the species under SARA and, as required under the Department’s “Do Not List Directive”, has prepared a 5 year workplan outlining the alternate approach that will be used to manage the species and its threats. The Science advice requested is required to fulfill, in part, the Department’s commitments under the workplan should the regional recommendation be accepted as the DFO's position on listing.  \n\nThis information will also be used to support changes to, or maintenance of, the current terminal licence policy in the commercial fishery.
