The Department is pursuing an amendment to this regulation to provide for flexibility in gear tending, on a fishery-by-fishery basis, where conservation objectives would not be compromised or could be achieved through other means.  Science advice is requested on the following.\n- What are the conservation considerations (e.g. on bycatch, target species, potential for ghost gear, response time for marine mammal response) associated with different gear tending time frames?\n- To what extent do these considerations vary across fixed gear and trap fisheries?\n- What scientific methodologies are recommended for determining the lethal and sub-lethal effects of different soak times on the catch?\n- Are there limitations that can be placed on soak times for certain gear types based on existing knowledge?",
            "consequence_text": "If science advice is not provided, there may be inconsistency in approaches across regions and fisheries to assessing requests from fleets for alternative soak times, as well as inefficiencies resulting from duplication of effort.  This could negatively affect species, habitats and ecosystems if important considerations are missed in assessing requests. \n\nFixed gear and trap fishing fleets across Atlantic Canada may an interest in the issue.  Environmental organizations will likely also have an interest.\n\n\n",
