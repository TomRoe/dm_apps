In particular, provide the following information:\n\n- fishery landings from previous years\n- area-weighted relative abundance from the summer RV survey \n- any length composition data.\n\nAn updated calculation of relative abundance from the NMFS survey is requested, one that takes into consideration length-based changes in catchability among survey vessels to standardize the time series.\n",
            "consequence_text": "If advice is not provided, it is likely that the TAC will be rolled-over, as has been the case in the past.  This could result in a higher than sustainable level of exploitation on the stock.\n\nSpiny Dogfish is a transboundary stock which we share with the northeastern US states.  This stock is not considered for collaborative management by TMGC.  In addition, a SARA listing decision (special concern) is pending for this stock. \n\nThis request relates to the productivity objective of the EAM Framework to keep fishing mortality of this stock moderate and will provide necessary information to meet the biodiversity objective to control unintended incidental mortality.",

In particular, advice will be provided to industry at the Scotia-Fundy Groundfish Advisory Committee meeting as part of the consultation on TAC decision-making for this stock.\n\nAlthough there is limited fishing for Spiny Dogfish currently in Canada, the fishery is anticipated to develop in Canada over the next few years.
