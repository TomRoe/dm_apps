The above noted research is being undertaken with an assumption that the parasite is not present above the dam. It is likely that DFO will receive a request in the future to stock eel above that dam that have been screened for the parasite.\n\nIs the swim bladder parasite currently present in American eel that are found above the Mactaquac Dam?",
