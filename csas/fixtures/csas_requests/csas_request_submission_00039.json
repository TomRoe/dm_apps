            "issue": "Review and evaluate biological and fishery information on 4VWX Silver Hake stock status and characterize the uncertainty of the results.  In particular, provide information on distribution, biomass estimates, length composition, age composition and condition, highlighting any trends over the long-term (length of assessment), mid-term (past 15 years) and most recent period (5 years).\n\nApplying the accepted framework, evaluate the consequences of different harvest levels during the 2021/22, 2022/23 and 23/24 fishery on stock abundance and exploitation rate.\n\nEvaluate the current status of the stock in relation to the accepted reference points. Comment on the relative informative value of the reference points.\n\nProvide advice to support the Record of Evidence for 4VWX silver hake which will be listed on Batch 1 of the Fish Stocks Provisions (Bill C-68). \n\nAnecdotal reports from industry indicate that silver hake is more widespread in Maritimes Region. Industry has requested authorization to fish outside of the current authorized areas for silver hake (i.e., LaHave and Emerald Basins, portion of the Shelf edge). Science advice is requested to support a management decision on this issue. Bycatch analysis of groundfish and other species (e.g., squid) in the fishery is requested.",
            "consequence_text": "If advice is not provided, the Scotia-Fundy Groundfish Advisory Committee would likely review the Research Vessel survey results.  The resultant TAC decision could be too aggressive and over-exploit the stock relative to the PA zone it occupies or too moderate and forgo substantial yield and value to the groundfish fishery. \n\nUnder the Proces-Verbal between Canada and France, 2% of the TAC for this stock is allocated to France in respect of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.\n\n",

In particular, the Science Advisory Report will be provided to industry at the Scotia-Fundy Groundfish Advisory Committee meeting as part of the consultation on 2022/23 TAC decision-making for this stock. \n\nThis stock was last assessed in 2012. The ability of the model to describe future biomass more than one year ahead is uncertain given that silver hake have highly variable recruitment patterns and the fishery prosecutes recruiting individuals (ages 1-2). The TAC for this stock is the highest for any groundfish stock in Maritimes Region and has not been fully caught in recent years. \n\n4VWX silver hake will be listed on Batch 1 of the Fish Stocks Provisions. \n\nThis request relates to the productivity objective of the EAM Framework to keep fishing mortality of this stock moderate.",
