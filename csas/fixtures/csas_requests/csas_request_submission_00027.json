Canada is also signatory to numerous UN Sustainable Fisheries resolutions calling on states to apply the precautionary approach and put in place measures to help ensure sustainable fisheries. This advice is required to meet these commitments.\n\nPeer reviewed science advice on harvest levels is required under the Department's \"A fishery decision-making framework incorporating the Precautionary Approach.\" This is one of several policies under the Department's \"Sustainable Fisheries Framework,\" which is the framework the Department has adopted to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.\n\nThe inshore lobster stocks have been identified as \"primary\" stocks in the Maritimes Region's \"Priority Setting Protocol for Fishery Assessment and Management: Primary and Secondary Stocks in the Maritimes Region\" (2012). In addition, one of the Minister’s priorities in her mandate letter is to “use scientific evidence and the precautionary principle . . . when making decisions affecting fish stocks and ecosystem management.” The advice is required to meet the Minister’s mandate commitment.",
