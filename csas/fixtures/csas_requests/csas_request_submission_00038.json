Include advice on harvest levels during the 2022 fishery and potential impacts on stock abundance and exploitation rate.\n\nCan improvements to the assessment framework and resulting Science advice be identified? This includes a review of the Traffic Light Analysis, including the biological basis for considering each index relevant to the shrimp stock and an alternate approach to summarising Traffic Light data that provides advice more directly related to Harvest Control Rules. Also review alternative biomass index assessment models. \n\n\nUpdate descriptive information related to the fishery, the survey, biology, and ecosystem interactions of the target species.",
            "consequence_text": "Should science advice not be provided, there may be implications for the following:\n\n1. Setting a TAC for the fishery. \n- If advice is not provided, the harvest level in 2022 will have to be based on the most recent data available, which would be the science stock status update from 2020. Using older information may result in an over or under-exploitation of the stock (with associated economic or conservation implications), given the potential for significant inter-annual variability in the status of the shrimp. A status quo TAC has been in place for the last 4 years. Science advice will be particularly important in order for management to set quotas appropriately. \n\n2. Marine Stewardship Council certification of the fishery\n- Lack of advice may generate public interest and pose potential negative economic impacts for the industry. \n\n3. Regional EBFM case study\n- Lack of advice will delay completion of a national case study for shrimp which includes evaluation of methods to improve ecosystem-informed advice to be included in decision-making in Resource Management.",
