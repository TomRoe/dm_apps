Identify any notable changes in occurrence of these bycatch species relative to previous years.\n\nPlease note: further discussion is required on process and advice impacts due to the lack of a 2020 survey and other COVID related concerns ",
            "consequence_text": "If advice is not provided, the SFA 29 West Advisory Committee would likely review any available survey results for the stock and recommend TACs similar to previous years without knowing the stock status in relation to the approved reference points.  The resultant TAC decision could be too aggressive and over-exploit the stock relative to the PA zone, possibly impeding its rebuilding to a healthy status. Conversely, overly cautious decisions would result in considerable economic loss.",
