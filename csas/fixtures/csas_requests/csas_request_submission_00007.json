In particular, update the RV survey index of abundance and the halibut survey index of biomass to include 2021, as well as the resulting TAC advice.\n\nWhat is the three-year geometric mean of the halibut survey â€“ scaled using the q from the SCAL model (or equivalent based on new model from spring 2021) - relative to the USR and the LRP?\n\nBycatch analysis of commercial halibut fishery using at-sea observer and logbook data, including temporal and spatial information for the catches of at-risk species, and identification of areas with high bycatch rates. \n\nProvide advice to support the Record of Evidence for Atlantic halibut to meet requirements of the Fish Stock Provisions (Bill C-68). \n",
            "consequence_text": "If advice is not provided, the Scotia-Fundy Groundfish Advisory Committee would likely review the Research Vessel survey results for indications of incoming recruitment.  The RV survey does not provide useful information on exploitable biomass and only covers a portion of the stock area (4VWX). The resultant TAC decision could be too aggressive and over-exploit the stock relative to the PA zone it occupies or too moderate and forgo substantial yield and value to the groundfish fishery.\n\n",

In particular, the Science Special Response will be provided to industry at the Scotia-Fundy Groundfish Advisory Committee meeting as part of the consultation on TAC decision-making for this stock. Atlantic halibut is the most economically viable stock to target in 4VsW, and the main target species in 4X for the FG<45' fleet.\n\nAtlantic halibut will be included on Batch 1 of the Fish Stock Provisions. \n\nThis request relates to the productivity objective of the EAM Framework to keep fishing mortality of this stock moderate and will provide necessary information to meet the biodiversity objective to control unintended incidental mortality. \n\nIn recent years, directed fishing on this stock by the U.S. in international waters and Saint Pierre and Miquelon in its territorial waters has increased, leading to increased interest from these countries in the stock trajectory and distribution. As well, industry stakeholders in NL Region have expressed increased interest in this stock, including the survey and resulting advice. ",
