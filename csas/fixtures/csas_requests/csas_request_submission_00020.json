Advice is for confirming the annual quota for the fishery, as required in the Integrated Fisheries Management Plan including (but not limited to):\n\n• An evaluation of the indicators\n• A compilation and review of information regarding the offshore Scotian Shelf spawning component and the coastal Nova Scotia spawning component.\n\n• Update on southwest New Brunswick migrant juvenile fishery component\n\n\n",
            "consequence_text": "If advice is not provided, the harvest level will have to be based on the most recent data available. Using older information may result in an over- or under-exploitation of the stock (with associated economic or conservation implications). Since many herring stocks in the Atlantic are showing productivity declines or in the critical zone, updated information on current stock status and trends is important to ensure appropriate management action is taken to limit the risk of falling into the critical zone. Lack of new science advice would also likely lead to negative feedback from industry, ENGOs, and possibly other stakeholders.",

The scientific recommendations that are made based on the background information will impact the economic return to local communities dependent on the resource.\n\nThe intended end users of the information and advice will be DFO resource management and the herring fishing and processing industries. DFO and other governmental agencies will use the data. Academic researchers and ENGOs could use the data.  \n\nHerring is a forage species and is part of the food web of several predators in the ecosystem. This request relates to the objective of conserving the productivity of this resource and its role in the ecosystem. Other specific ecosystem considerations include: what effect does primary productivity and oceanographic conditions have on the productivity of the species? How might we better account for the ecosystem role of herring in our science advice and management decision-making?",
