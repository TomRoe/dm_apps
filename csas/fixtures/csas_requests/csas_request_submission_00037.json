Is there critical information that needs to be collected to determine if there is a conservation risk?\n- The review should consider the extent and significance of the impact on the stock of undersized culling or high-grading after the catch is brought to the surface.\n\n The focus of this request is on SWNB, however, if possible the same information should be reviewed for ENS and SWNS. Stock Status in NS is also of concern due to reported die-off.",
            "consequence_text": "If advice is not provided, management will be based on the most recent data available. Using older information may result in an over- or under-exploitation of the stock (with associated economic or conservation implications). Continued lack of science advice may lead to negative feedback from some industry and ENGOs. With secondary species, industry is expected to collect data and conduct the science. With the commitment of DFO for more regular review of this data, it will increase credibility in the research and increase relationships and trust between DFO and the industry. ",
