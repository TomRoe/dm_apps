Additionally, there are other depleted species that are captured incidentally by the lobster fishery.    \n \nThis request relates to the productivity and biodiversity objectives of the EAM Framework to control unintended incidental mortality on species that are not the target of the fishery.\n\nCanada is a signatory to the 2002 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. Under the agreement Canada committed to implementing the precautionary approach in the fisheries it manages. Canada is also signatory to numerous UN Sustainable Fisheries resolutions calling on states to apply the precautionary approach and put in place measures to help ensure sustainable fisheries. This advice is required to meet these commitments.\n\nAdvice is required consistent with the Department's policy on bycatch.  This is one of several policies under the Department's \"Sustainable Fisheries Framework,\" which is the framework the Department has adopted to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. \n\nOne of the Minister’s priorities in her mandate letter is to “use scientific evidence and the precautionary principle . . . when making decisions affecting fish stocks and ecosystem management.” The advice is required to meet the Minister’s mandate commitment.",
