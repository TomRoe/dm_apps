There is inconsistency in the fishery where certain gear types are permitted to some licence holders in non-tidal waters while others are restricted. \n\nIs there a way to quantify the level of elver mortality that occurs at various distances above the tidal boundary? Is so, what is an acceptable distance from the tidal boundary that elver fishing could be carried out to ensure elvers with a high probability to survive have escaped the fishery? \n\nCertain gear types are authorized between 10-2500m above the tidal boundary, while the majority are set at 1000 m.\n\n",

In the event advice can be provided related to an acceptable distance above the tidal boundary where elver fishing can be carried out, resource management will seek to authorize fishing in non-tidal waters for all licence holders to bring parity and consistency to the fishery.\n\nAn example of the inconsistancy is the following breakdown of how many elver traps are currently authorized in non-tidal waters (distance in meters is the distance above the tidal boundary); two locations 2500 m, two at 2000 m, two at 1500 m, 39 at 1000 m, one at 30 m, and one at 10 m.
