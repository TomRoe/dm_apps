Provide interim advice for SPA 1A, 1B, 3 and 4 for 2022/23.  \nWhat by-catch of non target species information is available? Identify any notable changes in occurrence of these bycatch species relative to previous years. \n\nPlease note: further discussion is required on process and advice impacts due to the lack of a 2020 survey and other COVID related concerns ",
            "consequence_text": "If advice is not provided, the Inshore Scallop Advisory Committee would not be able to recommend TACs based on the current stock status in relation to the approved reference points. Exploitation rates relative the the limit removal reference would be unavailable, therefore the current harvest control zones could not be applied. The resultant TAC decision could be too aggressive and over-exploit the stock relative to the stock status zone under the precautionary approach, possibly impeding its rebuilding to a healthy status. Conversely, overly cautious decisions would result in considerable economic loss.",
