In particular, provide information on distribution, biomass estimates and length composition, highlighting biomass trends relative to 40% and 80% of the long-term average.  A table reporting the biomass estimate for each stock for 2018, 2019 and 2020, as well as the averages, is also requested.\n\nSuggested species for inclusion in the report are:  Cod, Haddock, Pollock, Silver Hake, Redfish, American Plaice, Witch Flounder, Winter Flounder, Atlantic Halibut, Yellowtail Flounder, White Hake, Wolffish, Monkfish, Thorny Skate, Barndoor Skate, Smooth Skate, Winter Skate, Little Skate, Spiny Dogfish, Sculpin, Blackbelly Rosefish, Black Sea Bass, Triggerfish, John Dory, and Tilefish.\n\nSpecies specific questions:\n- What is the five-year geometric mean of the 22 cm+ Unit 3 Redfish?\n- What are the three-year geometric means of the 42 cm+ 4X5 White Hake and 4VW White Hake?

The information will be used by DFO Resource Management as background for discussions with various industry stakeholders on recommendations for management measures, as well as determining which stocks to request be reviewed in more detail with a full assessment in the following year.\n\nInformation in the report is also used in the TAC decision-making framework for several commercial species.\n\nThe advice has become essential for addressing MSC conditions for stocks which are certified or undergoing certification.\n\nThis request relates to the productivity objective of the EAM Framework to keep fishing mortality of target species moderate and the biodiversity objective to control unintended incidental mortality of non-target species.",
