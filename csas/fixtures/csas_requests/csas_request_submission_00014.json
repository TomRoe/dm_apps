            "issue": "Based on advice from the exploratory license holder and from science conducted by Acadia University Science on Sea Lettuce and Nori it was concluded that the current cottage industry scale harvesting of these species is sustainable ecologically. The products have been tested and are marketable and continued harvesting is a potential new source of revenue for small business in Nova Scotia. The industry has advised on a maximum harvest of 250 kg (dry) per year for Nori and 500 kg (dry) for Sea Lettuce on Digby Neck and islands. \n\nIn order to consider moving this harvest to full commercial status we require Science involvement in reviewing the information provided by the industry. Specifically, advice is requested on what is required to take this exploratory fishery to a commercial harvest level.",
            "consequence_text": "The industry has provided yearly harvest reports and a series of recommendations on the management of the harvest industry for Sea Lettuce and Nori to ensure long term sustainability. Resource Management will continue to rely solely on this information and the expertise of the license holder.  This could have a negative impact on the Sea Lettuce and Nori population and the associated ecosystem, since there will be no independent review of this work in the near term.  It may also delay progress toward developing a robust assessment framework and moving towards a commercial harvest.",

Once DFO Science assessed the information provided by the licence holder it was determined that the information could not be assessed due to the methods in which it was carried out.\n\nIt was determined by DFO Science that science advice could be provided if the licence holder followed a protocol developed by DFO to record information in a manner that would allow for an assessment. The plan was not developed as a meeting could not occur with the licence holder and their advisor due to COVID-19 and the DFO science employee subsequently moved into a new position.",
