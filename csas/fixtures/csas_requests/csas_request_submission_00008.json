            "issue": "Review and evaluate biological and fishery information on 4X5Y Cod.  In particular, provide the following information and highlight any trends:\n\n- fishery landings from previous years;\n- research vessel (RV) survey biomass and length composition;\n- age-structured indices of abundance;\n- total mortality (Z) and relative fishing mortality (F) (to be used to evaluate against the proxy indicator for relative F [0.19]); \n- provide update on current stock status with respect to the LRP (as set during the 2018 Framework) and provide new three-year projections to evaluate exceptional circumstances); and\n- discuss whether exceptional circumstances should trigger an assessment for the following year.\n\nProvide advice to support the Record of Evidence for 4X5Y Atlantic cod which is anticipated to be listed on Batch 2 of the Fish Stock Provisions (Bill C-68).\n",
            "consequence_text": "If advice is not provided, the Scotia-Fundy Groundfish Advisory Committee would likely review the Research Vessel survey results for the stock or would consider a roll-over of the TAC (as bycatch), as has been the case in the past.  The resultant TAC decision could be too aggressive and over-exploit the stock relative to the PA zone, particularly considering that the most recent update indicated that the outlook for this stock is very poor. \n\nThe stock was re-assessed as Endangered by COSEWIC as part of the Southern Designatable Unit in 2010. A listing decision for this stock is pending.\n\nThe successful implementation of the PA policy (including a rebuilding plan) for this stock has been identified as a departmental priority under the response to the Fall 2016 CESD Audit on Sustaining major fish stocks. \n \nIn addition, Atlantic Cod has often been identified as a flagship species by ENGOs and academics when considering fisheries management in Canada.

Results will also be measured against Rebuilding Plan objectives for this stock.\n\nThe results will also be used to support the MSC certification requirements for the 4X5 Haddock fishery, which includes an evaluation of the likely impact of this fishery on 4X5Y Cod. \n\nThis request relates to the productivity objective of the EAM Framework to keep fishing mortality of this stock moderate and will provide necessary information to meet the biodiversity objective to control unintended incidental mortality.
