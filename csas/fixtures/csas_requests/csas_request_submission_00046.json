            "issue": "The Canadian Marine Invasive Screening Tool (CMIST) is a screening-level risk assessment tool for marine invasive species. It is a questionnaire that follows the invasion process from arrival to impact and is designed so an informed assessor can quickly evaluate one species in an assessment area using easily accessible information from databases, primary and grey literature. The CMIST was developed through a previous CSAS process. The AIS National Core Program - Maritimes Region is interested in Science advice on the applicability of the tool in freshwater environments, specifically: \n-does the Canadian Marine Invasive Screening Tool (CMIST) provide valid risk assessments for freshwater species? \n-is there a need for a separate Canadian Freshwater Invasive Screening Tool (CFIST)? If so, how would CMIST and CFIST differ?",
            "consequence_text": "If the science advice is not provided, groups, organizations, and the provincial governments applying to enact a management plan for a freshwater AIS may be confused about the process and the validity of the CMIST. This may result in these organizations either paying for an environmental consultant to conduct a risk assessment, using methods that have not been validated by DFO, or to drop the project all together due to a confusing process.

CMIST can provide such risk assessments for marine species and has been reportedly used for freshwater AIS. However, the results are not publicly available, nor have the amendments for using CMIST for freshwater (noted in the CMIST user manual) been made available. Therefore, a CMIST developed methodology validated for freshwater AIS would be very beneficial for regulatory purposes. Also, having a CMIST re-advertised as CFIST, Canadian Freshwater Invasive Screening Tool, with notes on the validated use of the modified CMIST methods would decrease confusion about whether or not CMIST can be used for freshwater AIS.

The draft freshwater AIS response plans propose that partners will need to complete a risk assessment using CMIST. Therefore, more direction about the process, including what the amendments to the CMIST protocol for freshwater are, and validation of CMIST for use in freshwater (CFIST) is needed to inform the completion of these response plans and decrease any potential confusion amongst partners.
