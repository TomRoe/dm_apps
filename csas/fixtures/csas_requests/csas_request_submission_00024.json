            "issue": "Review observer coverage levels in the 4VWX5 groundfish fishery (and at fleet levels) to determine whether information on bycatch of depleted, COSEWIC-assessed or SARA listed groundfish species (priorities: cusk, 4VW and 4X5 white hake, Winter skate (4VW) and Atlantic cod (4X5Y and 4VW)) is sufficient to provide estimates of bycatch for each of these species. If yes, please provide these estimates. If not, please determine levels of observer coverage needed to provide these estimates.\n\nIf time allows, other species for consideration include: Atlantic wolffish, American plaice, Northern wolffish, Spotted wolffish, Thorny skate, Smooth skate. \n",
            "consequence_text": "If advice on sufficient levels of ASO coverage to monitor these depleted species is not provided, it will remain uncertain whether we have adequate information to accurately assess the level of risk fisheries bycatch is posing to these COSEWIC-assessed, depleted species, and also uncertain whether current management measures (e.g., quota caps, trip limits) are sufficient to address this risk. This situation is inconsistent with the Departmental priority of protection of COSEWIC-assessed or depleted species, and addressing this knowledge gap has been identified as a commitment during multiple groundfish SARA listing processes. The Department will be expected to report against this commitment and our Departmental priorities for depleted species in the coming years, and determining whether current ASO levels are sufficient (and if not, what sufficient levels would be) is the necessary first step on which future management decisions for these species should be based.\n\nIf the requested science advice is not provided, it would impact the ability of DFO to apply the tool and achieve impactful results for the FMP policy.

            "rationale": "Questions about whether current ASO levels are adequate to effectively monitor the bycatch of depleted species have been raised during the SARA listing processes for multiple depleted groundfish species, including Cusk, White hake, Atlantic cod and Winter skate (4VW). A commitment to answer the question about ASO levels was included in the regionally-approved Cusk AAP to support the DNL under SARA recommendation, and a similar commitment is likely to get included in the AAP for White hake as well. In addition, it is anticipated that Winter skate may be recommended for listing under SARA and our ability to effectively monitor bycatch of this species will be an important component of implementing SARA requirement for this species.\n\nIn addition to SARA DNL and list considerations for these species, there is concern that cod is being discarded and that landings data do not accurately depict fishing mortality. 4X5Y cod is in the critical zone and is anticipated to be listed on Batch 2 of the Fish Stock Provisions.    \n \nThis request relates to the biodiversity objective of the EAM Framework to control unintended incidental mortality. \n\nDFO is beginning to implement the Fishery Monitoring Policy (FMP) at the operational level. This request supports the application of the policy and will also inform management decisions related to the deployment of observers in the fishery.  One of the objectives of the policy is to have dependable, timely and accessible fishery information necessary to help ensure that Canadian fisheries are managed to support the sustainable harvest of aquatic species. \n\nA review of the observer coverage levels in the 4VWX5 groundfish fishery (and at fleet levels) as proposed will assist in the implementation of the FMP policy in the fishery in two primary ways:\n• It will provide timely, dependable information related to the ability of current observer coverage levels to provide sufficient information to allow for an assessment of estimated bycatch of depleted species.   \n• It will provide an assessment which will allow resource managers to, if and where required, amend, increase or shift at-sea observer resources to ensure they are sufficient to provide estimates of bycatch for each of the species noted as a priority.   \n\n",
