So far, commercial quantities are likely to have been found in Offshore 4Vs, however no guidance has been formally provided on appropriate level of removals for this area. \n\nFor 4W, we have seen increases in landings in the last few seasons.  With requests for increases to quotas in 4W, a determination is required on whether or not this area has commercial quantities of whelk, and in turn whether the whelk fishery should continue in this NAFO area. If continuation is warranted, what would an appropriate level of removal be for this area be. \n\nIn follow-up to the 2020 CSAS Process - reaffirm and establish the indicators for continued monitoring of the fishery as the Department considers the transition from Exploratory to Commercial.\n\nIndustry requires submitting an Assessment Framework in consultation with DFO Science. Whether this could be part of this process remains unknown. \n \n\n\n\n",

Pressure will continue from higher levels within the Department on why the Region has not made a decision on this fishery. \n\nWith secondary species, industry is expected to collect data and conduct the science. With the commitment of DFO for more regular review of this data, it will increase credibility in the research and increase relationships and trust between DFO and the industry. Input from Science to Resource Management regarding Commercial Viability, also will strengthen the decision to proceed with a commercial fishery for other reasons outside the fact that people have been actively fishing these areas for substantial periods of time.

As this is a Secondary Fishery the process is dependent on Industry submitting the information required in order to review and provide advice in relation to this fishery. \n\nThe advice will be used by Resource Management to determine whether the Exploratory Whelk Fishery in 4Vs and 4W should move from Exploratory to Limited Entry, and what the levels of removals would be in order to move forward with Access decisions.
