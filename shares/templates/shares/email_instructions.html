  Hi {{ object.user.first_name }},
</p>
<p>
  Your account on the NAS server has been created. Here are your login credentials:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Username:</b></td>
    <td>\{{ object.username }}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Random password:</b></td>
    <td>{{ object.password }}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  If you would like to change this password, unfortunately you will have to come by my office and we can change it directly on the server.
  I have added you to the following share{{ object.shares.count|pluralize }}:
</p>

<ul>
  {% for share in object.shares.all %}
    <li>
      {{ share.network_path }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>{{ object.shares.count|pluralize:"This,These" }} folder{{ object.shares.count|pluralize }} can be mapped to your desktop just like any other folder.
  However when you enter in your credentials, <b>do not forget to include the backslash </b> in front of your username. </p>

<p>
  {{ request.user }}<br>
  <a href="mailto:{{ request.user.email }}">{{ request.user.email }}</a>
</p>
