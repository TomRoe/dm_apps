1) Personnel List View - creating two views of the record if 2 things are selected in M2M field - why??

2) In the "_html" pages -- how to have the main page refresh automatically after the pop up closes??

3) Lending tables -- how to get 'quantity' to show actual quantities -- maybe neeed an intermediary table to store quantitity lent out of an item??

4) Can I have a field in a model that is the sum of two (or more) other fields in a different model?
   i.e. I want to have different quantities of a unique item in different locations, but then have the total quantity somewhere as well

5) Quantity add form -- eventually when there are a lot of items, finding the one you want to add quantity to might be restrictive

6) Add additional filters for other columns? Or one filter that can search any column?

7) File upload field -- how to do properly
