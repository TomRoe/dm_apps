# TODO: not custodian test
# TODO: data manager field for a given section
# TODO: batch export of xml data
# TODO: histogram for my section page time since last certification


# Some features are currently hardcoded with yourself as the contact
# (ex. Send report to section head); this will need to detect the currently logged in admin
#  Definitely. I was thinking about adding a data management person field to each section.
#  That way, emails etc. will just default to that person.
#  But I like your suggestion about just looking at the person who is clicking the button.
#  That would probably be much easier and cleaner. The collaboration is already paying off :)
