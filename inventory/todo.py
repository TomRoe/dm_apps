# The ability to batch export all metadata .xml files listed under the GLLFAS division.
# This will enable easier local backup and serve as an “eject button” if IMTS decides to drop the hammer.
# This is a priority. – No problem. As noted on our call, these data are being backup in numerous ways.
# So if ever the hammer fell, we would not be completely up a creek, so to speak.

# The ability to query metadata entries that are complete/incomplete and/or require translation
# (i.e. ready or not for upload to FGP/Open Data) –
# If this is already possible please let me know. Not currently available but should be easy to implement.

# Some features are currently hardcoded with yourself as the contact
# (ex. Send report to section head); this will need to detect the currently logged in admin
#  Definitely. I was thinking about adding a data management person field to each section.
#  That way, emails etc. will just default to that person.
#  But I like your suggestion about just looking at the person who is clicking the button.
#  That would probably be much easier and cleaner. The collaboration is already paying off :)
